 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 as modifying the License.
 
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.
 
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
