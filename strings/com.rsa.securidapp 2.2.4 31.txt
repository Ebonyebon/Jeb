Unless RSA agrees otherwise in writing, this Agreement governs Customer's use of the Software and Hardware, except to the extent all or any portion of the Software or Hardware is: (a) the subject of a separate written agreement set forth in a quotation issued by RSA; or (b) governed by a third party licensors terms and conditions. Capitalized terms have meaning stated in the Agreement.&lt;br>&lt;br> By clicking on the “Agree” or “Accept” or similar button at the end of this Agreement,or proceeding with the installation, downloading, use or reproduction of this Software, or authorizing any other person to do so, you are representing to RSA that you are (&lt;span class=SpellE>i&lt;/span>) authorized to bind the Customer; and (ii) agreeing on behalf of the Customer that the terms of this Agreement shall govern the relationship of the parties with regard to the subject matter in this Agreement and are waiving any rights, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to any claim anywhere in the world concerning the enforceability or validity of this Agreement.&lt;br>&lt;br> If you do not have authority to agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of the Customer, or do not accept&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;b> &lt;i>the terms of this Agreement on behalf of the Customer, click on the “Cancel” or “Decline” or other similar button&lt;/i> &lt;i>at the end of this Agreement and/or immediately cease any further attempt to install, download or use this&lt;/i> &lt;i>Software for any purpose, and remove any partial or full copies made from this Software.&lt;/b>&lt;/i>&lt;br>&lt;br> &lt;b>1.DEFINITIONS.&lt;/b>&lt;br> &lt;b>A. “Affiliate”&lt;/b>means a legal entity that is controlled by, controls, or is under common “control” of RSA or Customer. “Control” means more than 50% of the voting power or ownership interests.&lt;br> &lt;b>B. “Confidential Information” &lt;/b>means and includes the terms of this Agreement and Software and all confidential and proprietary information of RSA or Customer, including without limitation, all business plans, product plans, financial information, software, designs, and technical, business and financial data of any nature whatsoever, provided that such information is marked or designated in writing as “confidential,” “proprietary,” or any other similar term or designation. Confidential Information does not include information that is rightfully in the receiving party’s possession without obligation of confidentiality prior to receipt from the disclosing party, (ii) a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party, (iii)rightfully furnished to the receiving party by a third party without restriction on disclosure or use; or (iv) independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information.&lt;br> &lt;b>C. “Distributor” &lt;/b> means a reseller, distributor, system integrator, service provider, independent software vendor, value-added reseller, OEM or other partner that is authorized by RSA to license Software to end users. The term shall also refer to any third party duly authorized by a Distributor to license Software to end users.&lt;br> &lt;b>D. “Documentation” &lt;/b> means the then-current, generally available, written user manuals and online help and guides for Software or Hardware provided by RSA.&lt;br> &lt;b>E. “Hardware”&lt;/b> means the hardware product that the Software is incorporated in or bundled with and sold as a unit and all Documentation for the foregoing.&lt;br> &lt;b>F. “Product Notice” &lt;/b>means the notice by which RSA informs Customer of product-specific use rights and restrictions, warranty periods, warranty upgrades and maintenance (support) terms. Product Notices may be delivered in an RSA quote, otherwise in writing and/or a posting on the applicable RSA website, currently located at http://www.emc.com/products/warranty_maintenance/index.jsp. The terms of the Product Notice in effect as of the date of the RSA quote shall be deemed incorporated into and made a part of the relevant Customer purchase order. Each Product Notice is dated and is archived when it is superseded by a newer version. RSA shall not change any Product Notice retroactively with regard to any Software listed on an RSA quote issued prior to the date of the applicable Product Notice. At Customer’s request, RSA shall without undue delay provide Customer with a copy of the applicable Product Notice and/or attach it to the relevant RSA quote.&lt;/br> &lt;b>G. “Quote(s)” &lt;/b>means one or more documents issued by RSA specifying the Software or Hardware that Customer seeks to obtain from RSA, the related pricing and sufficient other information to complete the transaction. Each Quote shall incorporate this Agreement by reference.&lt;/br> &lt;b>H. “Schedule(s)” &lt;/b>means a document provided by RSA to Customer by which Customer orders Software or Hardware and which is executed by the parties. Each Schedule shall incorporate this Agreement by reference.&lt;br> &lt;b>I. “Software” &lt;/b>means the RSA software product which requires acceptance of this Agreement, and any copies made by or on behalf of Customer and all Documentation for the foregoing.&lt;br>&lt;br> &lt;b>2. ORDERING, PRICING AND PAYMENT.&lt;/b>&lt;br> A Schedule or Quote will be deemed accepted by Customer when Customer places an order by: (i) providing an executed Schedule to RSA, (ii) signing a Quote and returning it to RSA, (iii) issuing an executed purchase order for the Software or Hardware on the Quote referencing this Agreement, or (iv) sending an email or other writing accepting the Quote. RSA may also accept a purchase order referencing this Agreement and issued by Customer provided however, this Agreement and any Schedule or Quote shall control in the event that there are different or additional terms set forth in any purchase order submitted by Customer. RSA will issue an invoice upon (i) shipment when Hardware is included, or (ii) when Software is made available to Customer through electronic file transfer or shipment of media containing the Software. Such invoice will reflect the price for such Software or Hardware as set forth on the Schedule or Quote. Fees for maintenance services, if any, shall be payable annually, in advance. Customer shall pay RSA the price stated on the invoice and also pay or reimburse RSA for all related taxes or withholdings, except for those taxes based on RSA’s net income. If Customer is required to withhold taxes, then Customer will forward any withholding receipts to RSA. All amounts are due in US currency and in full thirty (30) days after the date of RSA's invoice, with interest accruing thereafter at the lesser of 1.5&amp;#37; per month or the highest lawful rate.&lt;br>&lt;br> &lt;b>3. DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION.&lt;/b>&lt;br> &lt;b>A. Delivery. &lt;/b>Title and risk of loss to the Hardware shall transfer to Customer upon RSAs delivery to a carrier at RSAs designated point of shipment (“Delivery”). Unless otherwise agreed, a common carrier shall be specified by RSA. Software may be provided by (i) Delivery of physical media; or (ii) electronic means (where available from RSA). If the Hardware has not been sold (for example - a lease or rental transaction), then risk of loss thereto transfers at Delivery, but title does not.&lt;br> &lt;b>B. Installation and Acceptance.&lt;/b>RSAs obligation, if any, to install Software as part of the Software’s licensing fee, is set forth in the Product Notice. Acceptance that Software or Hardware operates in substantial conformity to the Documentation occurs upon Delivery or electronic availability, as applicable. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Customer retains all rights and remedies set forth in Section 5 (WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER) below.&lt;br>&lt;br> &lt;b>4. LICENSE TERMS.&lt;/b>&lt;br> &lt;b>A. General License Grant. &lt;/b>Subject to Customers compliance with this Agreement, the Product Notice, and payment of all license fees, RSA grants to Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable (except as otherwise permitted herein) license (with no right to sublicense) to use (i) Software for Customer’s internal business purposes; and (ii) the Documentation for the purpose of supporting Customer’s use of Software or Hardware. Licenses granted to Customer shall, unless otherwise indicated on the Product Notice or quote from RSA or Distributor be perpetual and commence on Delivery of the physical media or the date Customer is notified of electronic availability, as applicable. Documentation is licensed solely for purposes of supporting Customers use of Software or Hardware as permitted in this Section. To the extent applicable to Software, Customer may be required to follow RSA’s then current product registration process, if any, to obtain and input an authorization key or license file.&lt;br> &lt;b>B. Licensing Models.&lt;/b> Software is licensed for use only in accordance with the commercial terms and restrictions of the Software’s relevant licensing model, which are stated in the Product Notice and/or quote from RSA or Distributor.&lt;br> &lt;b>C. License Restrictions.&lt;/b> All Software licenses granted herein are for use of object code only. Customer is permitted to copy Software as necessary to install and run it in accordance with the license, but otherwise for back-up purposes only. Customer may copy Documentation insofar as reasonably necessary in connection with Customer’s authorized internal use of Software. Customer shall not, without RSA's prior written consent (i) use Software in a service bureau, application service provider or similar capacity; or (ii) disclose to any third party the results of any comparative or competitive analyses, benchmark testing or analyses of Software performed by or on behalf of Customer; (iii) make available Software in any form to anyone other than Customers employees or contractors; (iv) transfer Software to an Affiliate or a third party; or (v) for any Software that is licensed with Hardware, Customer may only use such Software on the Hardware on which it was provided.&lt;b"</string>
