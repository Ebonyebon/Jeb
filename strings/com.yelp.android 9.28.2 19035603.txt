The dish was excellently prepared. Grilled, juicy, and fresh without a hint of fishiness. A glaze of tangerine sauce brought a hint of tart sweetness. The fish was placed on a mound of sweet plantain rice. The combination of the fish and rice alone was to die for!"</string>

    <string name="review_hint">Example: This is probably my favorite steakhouse in town. If you’re going to splurge, this is the place to do it. The service is prompt but gruff, though I’d argue that’s part of the rustic steakhouse feel. Our waiter, Tom, was able to give us some great guidance and was especially helpful for pairing beers with our steaks. Everything you’ve heard is 100% true and then some! Obviously the steak is the main event, and every time I go it’s top-notch — juicy and perfectly cooked. Don’t skip dessert! The housemade cheesecake is out-of-this-world good, so save room on your main course!</string>
