    <string name="about_dialog_text">"Miiskin is the result of what most of all feels like an ongoing struggle against my girlfriend’s moles on her back. She has quite a lot. Twelve have already been removed, and even though we keep an eye on the remaining, there’s always a little doubt: Isn’t this a newcomer? And has this one gotten a bit bigger? It is maddeningly difficult for the human eye to make an overall assessment on such a complicated pattern – a bit like looking at the sky night after night trying to identify a new or a more bright shining star. Miiskin's goal is to make tracking of mole changes easy.

Melanoma can be cured if it is diagnosed in the earliest stages. If not - it is one of the most deadly types of cancer.

Miiskin is a Copenhagen based company, focusing on making monitoring of skin concerns easy.

 10. Agreement; Assignment; Miscellaneous

 10.1 The Terms constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement between you and us. It supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreement, oral or written, and any other communications, representations, warranties and understanding relating to the subject matter of the Terms. If there is a conflict between an oral or written representation of any Miiskin employee or agent and the Terms (other than modifications to the Terms executed in writing by the CEO or authorized-in- fact representative of Miiskin), the Terms will prevail.
 10.2 If any provision(s) of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Miiskin’s failure to exercise or enforce any of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of Miiskin’s right to exercise or enforce the Terms as to the same or another instance. Headings in this and related agreements are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of the Terms.
 10.3 You agree that Miiskin may assign the Terms to any other entity of its choosing, with or without notice to you. You may not assign the Terms to any other party for any reason. Miiskin shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies unless such waiver is in writing and signed by an officer of Miiskin. No delay or omission on the part of Miiskin in exercising any rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies or any other rights or remedies on future occasions.
