    <string name="guide_to_autodox_message10">"Sometimes folder names can be long say ‘Insurance policies’ so your AutoDox ID also becomes long to type and tough to recall.

We let you chose a short alias name instead say ‘IP’ or even a number ‘1’ so that you can save time."</string>
    <string name="guide_to_autodox_message11">HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO UPLOAD?</string>
    <string name="guide_to_autodox_message12">"Almost real time. Your documents will be in your ALLDOX account in no more than a few minutes.

    <string name="guide_to_inshare_message2">When you share your documents via MailBox they do not leave the secure environment of ALLDOX, unlike email or any other public sharing platforms.</string>
    <string name="guide_to_inshare_message3">HOW DO I SEE DOCUMENTS RECEIVED IN MAILBOX?</string>
    <string name="guide_to_inshare_message4">"You will receive an email to notify you that you have received a document in your MailBox. You will find the Mailbox folder under the Folders tab of your Mydox page.

After viewing the document, you can choose to reject it or save it to your account. To download or share the document further, you will need to save it to your account first."</string>

    <string name="guide_to_list_message1">WHY DO I NEED A LIST?</string>
    <string name="guide_to_list_message2">"If you have various documents spread across multiple folders that are related, you can group all these documents using a LIST. It will help you to search and locate documents easy.

E.g. your insurance policies could be spread across multiple folders - Home Insurance with your other home documents, Car Insurance with your other Car documents, Medical Insurance with your other Health Documents, etc.

By creating a list, say ‘Insurance Plolicies’, you can add all these policies to the list and view &amp; handle them in a single window, like you would view documents in a folder.

You can add a single document to multiple lists, e.g. your health insurance policy could be added to your Health folder, to your Insurance Policies list, to your Pending Claims list as well as your Tax Filing 2017 list. How cool is that?"</string>

    <string name="guide_to_location_message2">Location is where you keep an original paper document or any document like thing (e.g. X ray plate or an important CD). It could be red file folder in living room cupboard or the first drawer of office desk.</string>

    <string name="guide_to_location_message4">"You can add a new location from Locations tab on the MyDox page or when you are uploading or editing a document.

Add a suitable name that you will remember easily. POSITIONS are descriptors for a location. For example, yellow file folder can be a POSITION for a location. You can add more POSITIONS for the location e.g. 3rd drawer, Left side, Black cupboard, Office cabin.

You can also add a SNAPSHOT of the location using camera when using ALLDOX mobile apps."</string>

    <string name="message_why_security_plus"><b>Why should I enable two factor verification?</b>"
Two factor verification adds an additional layer of security to your allDox account. Most people have only one layer of security to protect their account - their password. With two factor verification, access to your email address would also be required to view your important documents.

How does it work?
To access your account, in addition to your username and password, you'll enter a security code that allDox will send you via email to your primary and alternate email addresses. This code can be used only once, a new code will be sent to you each time you log in.

Why do I need to provide an alternative email address?
Once two factor verification is enabled, you will not be able to access your account without the security code(OTP). In case your primary email is inaccessible, you can use your alternate email address to view your security code to complete log in.
