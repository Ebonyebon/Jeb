It may require that you return your vehicle to the dealer for service. If your vehicle is not affected, it may be because it was built at a different time or using a different part than the affected vehicles.

There may be temporary delays in update of information on this site due to a number of factors.

    <string name="recall_disclaimer_canada">"A Recall is an action by the Company to remedy a Safety, Emissions or Compliance issue with respect to a vehicle. A Safety Recall is implemented to address a vehicle defect that affects or is likely to affect the safety of any person. An Emissions Recall or a Compliance Recall is implemented to address non-compliance with prescribed regulatory standards. A Customer Satisfaction Program is an action by the Company to provide additional coverage or repairs as part of the Company's commitment to building a community of happy, satisfied customers. Recalls or Customer Satisfaction Programs may require that you return your vehicle to a Ford or Lincoln dealer for service or repair. If your vehicle is not affected by a particular Recall or Customer Satisfaction Program, it may be because it was built at a different time or using a different part than the affected vehicles.

    <string name="about_vehicle_health_brakes_child">"​Your vehicle's Anti-lock Braking System helps maintain steering control during emergency stops by keeping the brakes from locking.

Your hybrid or battery electric vehicle's Regenerative Braking system helps achieve maximum energy-efficiency by capturing some of the energy normally lost as heat during braking, and recycling it to recharge your battery.

AdvanceTrac with RSC system (if equipped) provides stability enhancement features for certain driving situations. Air suspension (if equipped) enhances ride and handling. The Trailer Brake Controller (if equipped), when used properly, helps ensure smooth and effective trailer braking. Hill descent (if equipped) helps you to set and maintain vehicle speed while descending steep grades regardless of surface conditions.

On-board computers monitor these systems and report to you."</string>
    <string name="about_vehicle_health_brakes_group">Brakes &amp; Suspension</string>
    <string name="about_vehicle_health_checks_child">"​Your gasoline or diesel engine vehicle's onboard computers monitor engine oil pressure, engine coolant temperature, and fuel level. On diesel engines, it also monitors fuel and air filter cleanliness. Your hybrid or battery electric vehicle's on-board computer monitors the cooling system for your lithium-ion battery. Warning indicators will indicate if any of these parameters are out of normal range. See your owner's manual for details of the warning indicators in your vehicle.

As an added safety feature, your vehicle may be equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure indicator light when one or more of your tires are significantly under-inflated.

Be sure to use only recommended fuels, lubricants, fluids and service parts conforming to specifications when maintaining your vehicle. Motorcraft parts are designed and built to provide the best performance in your vehicle."</string>
    <string name="about_vehicle_health_checks_group">Checks, Fluids &amp; Filters</string>
    <string name="about_vehicle_health_engine_child">"Your gasoline or diesel engine's power is delivered to the driving wheels by the transmission. The transmission uses gears, electro-hydraulics, and sensors to optimize vehicle performance.

Your on-board computer monitors gasoline or diesel engine performance, adapts automatic transmission shifting (if equipped), optimizes diesel cold weather starting, controls emissions and balances performance with fuel economy.

Your hybrid or battery electric vehicle's high-voltage battery powers your electric motor, which transfers power to the driving wheels through the single speed transmission. Your hybrid or battery electric vehicle's on-board computer monitors your electric motor, battery, and transmission to provide you with optimal range and performance.

If equipped, your vehicle's 4WD or AWD system delivers engine power to all four wheels through the transmission, transfer case, and driveshafts. An on-board computer monitors the 4WD/AWD system and reports to you."</string>

    <string name="about_vehicle_health_restraints_child">"​Your vehicle is equipped with safety belts and an air-bag Supplemental Restraint System.

Intelligent Key access (if equipped) unlocks your vehicle when you approach and also allows you to start it without putting a key in the ignition lock cylinder as long as the key is on you or in the vehicle.

Active Park assist (if equipped) can steer the vehicle into a parking space while you control the accelerator, gearshift and brakes. Reverse Sensing System (if equipped) can warn of objects near the rear bumper when backing up. Blind Spot Information System (if equipped) can detect if a vehicle is in your blind spot. Cross Traffic Alert system (if equipped) can detect vehicles approaching from either side when backing out of a parking spot.

Adaptive cruise control (if equipped), adjusts speed to maintain a pre-set distance between you and the vehicle in front in the same lane. Collision Warning with brake support (if equipped) can alert you of certain collision risks. Lane Keeping System (if equipped) can detect drifting toward the outside of the lane.

Hill start assist (if equipped) automatically prevents the vehicle from rolling back or forward (when in reverse) on a slope by momentarily holding brake pressure when the brake pedal is released.
