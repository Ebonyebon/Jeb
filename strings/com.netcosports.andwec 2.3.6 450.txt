    <string name="__inside_presentation_p1">"When the FIA World Endurance Championship took to the tracks in March 2012, it marked the dawning of a new era in endurance racing.Just three seasons later, some of the world’s most prestigious and successful motor manufacturers including Aston Martin, Audi, Corvette, Ferrari, Nissan, Porsche and Toyota are participating in this most technically relevant of motorsport disciplines.  
In 2016, teams representing these marques will be among the 35 entries battling it out for World Championship titles in front of an ever-growing audience of fans and followers.  The WEC will race on four continents and continue to bring the ‘Spirit of Le Mans’ to motorsport fans in the UK, Belgium, Germany, USA, Japan, China and Bahrain.  The cornerstone of the Championship, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, will once again be the third round and bring together the crème de la crème of international endurance racing for the greatest sportscar race in the world.
In 2014 the new LMP1 regulations for renewable energy were implemented and endurance racing is once again at the forefront of the technological research and development which goes into our road cars of tomorrow. The fact that 30 percent less fuel was used to achieve lap times that matched, or even surpassed, those of 2013 demonstrates what can be achieved through relevant motorsport."</string>
    <string name="__inside_presentation_p2">"Beyond the manufacturer teams and professional drivers in the LMP1 category, the competition in LMP2 and the GTE categories is sure to once again be fierce. The LMP2 class will benefit from the presence of a number of new, high-level entrants, while in the GTE category Aston Martin and Porsche will be determined to challenge three-time GT World Champions, Ferrari.  Endurance Racing is nothing without the private teams and gentlemen drivers who race in some of these categories, and their participation adds to the challenge, excitement and spirit of the discipline.  
With one new venue, the legendary Nürburgring in Germany, new teams, new drivers and the prospect of even closer competition, 2016 will see another thrilling World Endurance Championship season.  Welcome to our world!"</string>

In sports car racing driver line ups do not always remain constant throughout the season, and it is therefore important that this takes place at every event to ensure that everyone complies with the regulations.

He may decide to use a Full Course Yellow and/or deploy the Safety Car

Full Course Yellow \"FCY\"
The Race Director may declare a Full Course Yellow period. Once under FCY, cars will slow down to 80 kph, in single file, and maintain their distance to the car in front and the car behind. Overtaking is strictly prohibited under the FCY.

Once the message is displayed on the monitors, all cars must immediately slow down.

All marshal posts will display a waved yellow flag and a board with the indication FCY 

The pit lane entry and exit remain open and cars are free to pit.

Once the problem is solved, the Race Director will return the track to green; this is done by posting a message on the monitors and all marshal posts will replace the yellow flags and FCY boards with waved green flags.

Racing and overtaking will normally resume without restrictions, regardless of the positions of the cars relative to one another and to the line.

An FCY period may be followed by a Safety Car intervention if the problem remains unsolved and safety may be at risk.

Safety Car SC
When the Race Director gives the order to deploy the safety car all marshal posts will display waved yellow flags and \"SC\" boards and the orange lights will be illuminated, for the duration of the intervention.

Once the \"Safety Car\" message is displayed on the monitors, all cars will slow down, and the \"Pit Entry Closed\" signal will be activated.

The safety car will start from the pit lane with its orange lights illuminated and will join the track regardless of where the race leader is.

All the competing cars must then form up in line behind the safety car and overtaking, unless signalled to do so by the safety car, is forbidden until the cars reach the start-finish line after the safety car has returned to the pits.

When ordered to do so the observer in the safety car will use a green light to signal to any cars between it and the race leader that they should pass. These cars will continue at reduced speed and without overtaking until they reach the line of cars behind the safety car.

If deemed appropriate, the Race Director will authorise the \"Pass-Around\" for any car that has their class leader behind them in the order circulating behind the safety car.

The safety car shall be used at least until the car in the lead is behind it and all remaining cars are lined up behind the leader.

During the first three laps of the safety car, the pit entry will be closed. Any car entering the pits during these first three laps shall be allowed to refuel for only 5 seconds and/or replace a damaged tyre, on the condition that after the third lap, or as soon as the pit entry opens, the car comes back in again for a normal pit stop.

When the Clerk of the Course calls in the safety car, its orange lights will be extinguished; this will be the signal that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point, the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than five car lengths behind it.

As the safety car is approaching the pit entry, the yellow flags and SC boards at the marshal posts will be withdrawn and replaced by waved green flags and green lights."</string>

It is permitted to add cameras on the car and screens inside the cockpit for rear and front/side vision. The screens must have a day/night mode. A rear facing camera is mandatory for LMGTE.

Headrest and head protection
All cars must be equipped with three areas of padding for the driver’s head protection which are positioned so as to be the first point of contact for the driver's helmet in the event of an impact projecting his head towards them during an accident.

Unintentional movement of the vehicle (LMP1 Only)
A device must prevent powered movement of the vehicle whenever the driver is not fully seated in the driver's seat.

Safe / Live Signage (LMP1 hybrid only)
The Safe / Live Signage must be directly linked to the ERS status whatever incident may occur.
In order to clearly show that it could be life-threatening to work on the Power Circuit.

Rollover structures 
Two safety rollover structures (front and rear) are mandatory for LMP1 and LMP2.  A safety cage meeting the requirements of the International Sporting Code is required for LMGTE.

Rear Impact absorbing structure (LMP1 Only)
An impact absorbing structure must be fitted behind the gearbox symmetrically about the car centre line.

Survival cell and frontal protection
The chassis structure must include a survival cell including the fuel tank, extending at least 150 mm in front of the driver's feet to behind the fuel tank.  

Firewalls
A perfectly sealed metallic firewall preventing the passage of flames from the engine compartment into the cockpit is fitted to all cars"</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_sanctions_protests">"During a race event the Stewards may impose penalties set out in the present regulations.  These range from imposing a fine, a stop-go or drive through penalty, right up to exclusion from the race and results.

If a competitor wishes to appeal the decision of the Stewards they have the option to take their case to the International Court of Appeal (ICA).  If an appeal is lodged then the results of the event are left as provisional until the ICA has reviewed the case and ruled."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_start_procedure">"For all WEC races there will be a rolling start.

The start procedure begins at least 30 minutes before the start of the formation lap.  The cars will leave their pits to cover one or more reconnaissance laps before taking their place in a Le Mans-style “ear of corn” formation along the pit wall, facing the grandstands on the opposite side of the track. 

After the closing of the pit lane exit, any car that is still in the pits will start the race from the pit lane exit. 

Before the national anthem is played, the driver or drivers who are not taking the start must line up across the track level with the front of their car towards the grandstand.  A maximum of four mechanics and two other people from each team are permitted to stand with the drivers.

Countdown to the start of the race will be signalled by the showing of boards reading \"5 minutes\", \"3 minutes\", \"1 minute\" and \"30 sec.\", accompanied by an audible warning.

When the green flag is shown, the pole position car will start and each car will follow one after the other away from the grid behind the Leading Car.  Cars must take up and maintain their grid positions until the race starts at the end of the formation lap(s)."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_starting_grid">"The starting grid for each race is announced 1 hour after the end of qualifying.
Two drivers from each crew must set at least one timed lap during the 20-minute qualifying period. 

The average of the two best lap times (the best lap of each driver) will serve as the reference time for establishing the grid.

NOTE:  In 2014 two drivers were required to set at least two timed laps during qualifying and the four best laps (the best two laps for each driver) served as the reference time."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_stops">"The pit lane is divided into three areas:
Fast lane - this is the lane closest to the pit wall.
Acceleration and deceleration lane -  this is the central lane.
Working lane area - this is the are closest to the garage, where work may be carried out on the cars. It is formed on one side by a wall or by a line painted in front of the pit shutter and on the other by a line separating it from the central lane.

When a car stops in the working lane area, it must park at least 50 cm from the wall or from the line marking the working area (the 2.50 m line).

Speed limit: 60 kph in the pit lane.

Only when the car is stopped outside its garage may the driver:
        •        Remove the safety harness,
        •        Switch off the lights,
        •        Cut the engine.
        •        Open the door.

If a car needs to be worked on in its garage, it must have been parked beforehand in the \"working area\" parallel to the track, and then pushed by a maximum of 4 mechanics, with the engine switched off.

When the car is to rejoin the fast lane, it must be pushed outside the garage and placed on the \"working area\" parallel to the track. The engine must then be started by the driver alone.

Before leaving his pit, the driver must:
        •        Fasten the safety harness,
        •        Switch on the lights.

It is strictly prohibited to spin the wheels when a car leaves its pit.

If a driver overruns the pit area, or breaks down on leaving the pit area, the car can only be moved back to it by the team's mechanics (a maximum of 4). The use of the reverse gear is strictly prohibited.

Cars in the fast lane have priority over those leaving the working lane area.  The team are responsible for the safe release of a car from its pit area."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_suspension">"The decision to stop practice or the race lies with the Race Director and this will be done by declaring a Red Flag.

Should it become necessary to suspend the race because the circuit is blocked by an accident or because weather or other conditions make it dangerous to continue, the Clerk of the Course will order the red flag to be shown simultaneously at the start line and at all marshal posts and will order the red lights switched on around the circuit.

When the signal to suspend the race is given, overtaking is prohibited, the pit entry and exit will be closed, and all drivers must drive their cars slowly to the red flag line, situated before the pit entry.

The safety car will be placed in front of the cars lined up behind the red flag line.

Driving time during a red flag period will not be counted and the stewards will confirm the updated driving times before the restart of the race.

If the circumstances so require, the Stewards may take the decision to stop and/or modify the race time set. 

The drivers are allowed to get out of their cars but they must remain with them.

Driver changes are prohibited

No repairs are authorised in the pits

If the race is suspended due to a sudden weather change, The Race Director, for safety reasons, may decide to authorise a tyre change from slicks to wet-weather tyres.  If this is the case, the tyre change must be carried out after the 10 minute board for the restart of the race.

The restart of the race will follow the same procedure as the normal start with a 10 minute countdown."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_tech_scrutineering">"Before any car is authorised to compete in a round of the WEC, it must be submitted for Technical Scrutineering by a team of officially appointed Scrutineers from the ACO to ensure that it complies with the latest technical and safety regulations.

Each car has a ‘passport’ which includes all its homologation documents and history and this is presented by the team manager or race engineer to the Scrutineers.

The day before practice starts each car is taken to a garage in the pit lane devoted to these checks.  It is weighed, measured and thoroughly checked for compliance, particularly in the case where as accident has taken place in the preceding event and it has been repaired, or when new parts are introduced. 

A car is not permitted to take part in the event if it has not passed Technical Scrutineering."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_titles_unformatted" formatted="false">"Because endurance racing features multi-class racing, there are effectively four different championship battles being fought out at the same time, within the one event.  There is only one overall winner of the race, usually a car from the fastest LMP1 category, but the winners of the LMP2, LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am classes are also recognised.
Titles for which prizes and trophies are awarded at the end of the season are:
        •        FIA World Endurance Drivers' Championship:  Reserved for LMP1 and LMP2 drivers (combined classification of LMP categories).  Driver line ups of two or three, having formed a permanent crew throughout the Championship season, will all score the same number of points and, if applicable, may all be awarded the Drivers' title.

        •        FIA World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship:  \"Manufacturer\" means the association constituted by the manufacturer of the chassis and the manufacturer of the engine.  Those eligible for 2016 are Audi, Nissan, Porsche and Toyota. The results obtained at each event by the two best classified cars of the same manufacturer entered for the full season count towards this championship. 

        •        FIA World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers:  Reserved for GT drivers (Pro and Am combined) and, as above, can be awarded to more than one driver from a crew during the championship season.

        •        FIA World Endurance Cup for GT Manufacturers:  Reserved for Manufacturers entered in LMGTE (Pro and Am combined). The results obtained at each event by the two best classified cars of the same manufacturer entered for the full season count towards this championship. 

        •        FIA Endurance Trophy for Private LMP1 Teams:  The LMP1 Private Teams category is reserved exclusively for private teams, independent of a manufacturer apart from supply of engines.  These LMP1 cars are non-hybrid and the trophy is awarded only if at least three cars are entered for the full season.

        •        FIA Endurance Trophy for Private LMP1 Team Drivers:  Awarded to the drivers who have gained the most points during the championship season and reserved for the drivers of cars entered in the LMP1 category as Private Teams.

        •        FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Teams:  Awarded to the LMP2 team which has gained the most points during the championship season. 

        •        FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Drivers:  Awarded to the drivers who have gained the most points during the championship season and reserved for the drivers of cars entered in the LMP2 category.

        •        FIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Am Teams:  Awarded to the LMGTE Am team which has gained the most points during the championship season. 

        •        FIA Endurance Trophy for GTE Am Drivers:  Awarded to the drivers who have gained the most points during the championship season and reserved for the drivers of cars entered in the LMGTE Am category.

POINTS

At all six-hour races (i.e. all WEC races except the Le Mans 24 Hours), points will be awarded for the following places providing the leader has completed more than 75% of the original race time:

1st         25 points
2nd         18 points
3rd         15 points
4th         12 points

6th         8 points
7th         6 points
8th         4 points
9th         2 points
10th         1 point

And beyond: 0.5 point* (awarded to any car classified lower than 10th in the general classification of an event).

For the Le Mans 24 Hours race only, double points are awarded. 

- One additional point will be awarded to the “pole position” team at each event, as well as to all the drivers making up the crew of the car concerned, in each of the four categories.

- Additional cars, such as those sometimes entered by manufacturers or from other endurance championships on a race-by-race basis, do not score points for the Championship titles, but do retain their place in the classification at the end of each Championship Event. 

- Half points will be awarded to the crews if the leader has completed more than two laps but less than 75% of the original race time. 

- In the event of any ties for position, the team or drivers with superior race results (based on descending order, from number of wins to numbers of second-places down) will take the title."</string>
    <string name="__inside_rules_sport_desc_trophies">"Immediately after the race the podium ceremony will be held for the top three crews in the general classification and in each category. 

Trophies will be presented to all members of the top three driver crews plus a representative from the winning team.

The podiums will be held in the following order
        •        Overall classification with the 1st LMP1 Privateer
        •        LMGTE Pro
        •        LMP2
        •        LMGTE Am"</string>
