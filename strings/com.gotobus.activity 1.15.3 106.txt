 General Information
 THE TRAVEL SERVICES AVAILABLE ON GOTOBUS.COM ARE PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS (SUPPLIERS) THAT ARE NOT AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES OF GOTOBUS. UNLESS PROHIBITED BY LAW, ORDINANCE, OR REGULATION, GOTOBUS DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR ANY ACTS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, BREACHES OR NEGLIGENCE OF ANY SUCH SUPPLIERS OR FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURIES, DEATH, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR LOSS, INCONVENIENCE, LOSS OF ENJOYMENT, MENTAL DISTRESS OR OTHER SIMILAR MATTER, DELAYED DEPARTURE, MISSED CONNECTION, SUBSTITUTION OF SERVICE OR ACCOMMODATIONS, TERMINATIONS OF SERVICE, OR CHANGES IN FARES AND RATES, AND/OR CANCELLATION OR DOUBLE BOOKING OF RESERVATIONS BY THE SUPPLIER. ALL TRAVEL SERVICES AND DOCUMENTS ISSUED ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIED BY SUPPLIERS. All content on the site is subject to amendment without notice. All content is published in good faith but GotoBus does not check the accuracy of all information provided by Suppliers. GotoBus corrects errors and omissions upon learning of the same. GotoBus reserves the right to cancel a reservation, without liability or penalty to you, if an error or omission leads to a material and unreasonable outcome (i.e. a five star hotel sold for ). You must confirm the Supplier's ability to meet special needs requests such as wheelchair accessible rooms directly with the Supplier. You should confirm this information immediately after confirmation of a reservation by GotoBus. The site provides an invitation to you to make an offer to purchase travel inventory. GotoBus is not making an offer to sell any travel inventory by providing access to the travel inventory to you on the site. You make an offer to purchase travel inventory when you complete all of the following: read our Terms and Conditions, click on I have read and agree with the Terms &amp; Conditions stated above to indicate your approval and understanding of our Terms and Conditions, and click on Complete My Order to finalize the offer to purchase the reservation. GotoBus is free to accept or reject your offer to purchase. GotoBus's acceptance or rejection of your offer occurs when notice of the same leaves GotoBus email service. Upon acceptance of your offer, GotoBus will charge the entire payment owed, including applicable taxes and service fees when applicable, to the credit card that you provided to GotoBus. Reservations depend on availability of travel products and are subject to confirmation upon payment. You must ensure that the information that you provide to GotoBus when making a reservation is accurate. You must inform GotoBus of any relevant changes to your contact information and/or other relevant changes to the information that you provided to GotoBus at the time of the reservation. The information provided on the site relating to mapping and distances is provided for informational purposes only and is not a guarantee or warranty of any kind by GotoBus. Your use of this site is subject to our Privacy Policy. Bus Tickets
 Your purchase of bus tickets is not accepted and confirmed until GotoBus sends an email, including ticket confirmation numbers, advising of the confirmation of the reservation and receipt of payment in full. All bus ticket purchases are non-refundable and non-transferable. Bus ticket purchases may, under certain circumstances, be exchanged prior to departure subject to payment of processing fees, any increases in fare, and similar surcharges which will be assessed at the time of the exchange. Changes to and cancellations of bus tickets can be made only if the Supplier and specific bus ticket rules permit the same. With the exception of self rescheduling online, GotoBus will charge a $5.00 processing fee per ticket for each change or cancellation request made through GotoBus's customer service agent by phone/email/fax. This processing fee will be charged in addition to the fee assessed by the Supplier. In addition, any increase in fare will be applicable. The processing fee may appear as a separate charge from GotoBus on the credit card statement. All approved changes and cancellations will be confirmed by an email confirmation notice from GotoBus. Tours, Vacation Packages, Show (Activity)
 Your purchase of Activity tickets is not accepted and confirmed until GotoBus sends an email, including ticket confirmation numbers, advising of the confirmation of the reservation and receipt of payment in full. GotoBus initial automated notification email, which does not contain ticket numbers, will be sent prior to the confirmation and is NOT a confirmation of the reservation even if the site indicates availability. If you do not receive a second email with the ticket numbers within 48 hours of booking, it is your responsibility to contact the GotoBus's customer support immediately. Packages and tours containing a bus component shall be subject to policies regarding bus tickets irrespective of the value of the components of the package or tour. Hotels
 Your purchase of hotel service is not accepted and confirmed until GotoBus sends an email, including ticket confirmation numbers, advising of the confirmation of the reservation and receipt of payment in full. Age restrictions apply to reservation of hotel rooms. Generally, you must be at least 21 years of age to check into a hotel room. Review of the site is required for specific age restrictions relating to each reservation. Rates quoted are per room per night; hotel taxes and service fees are disclosed at the time of reservation, if applicable. Unless specifically stated on your reservation, rates do not include meals. Star ratings may be different to official ratings as they vary significantly by country / region, and often within countries. Hence it is your responsibility to review the description of hotel facilities, rooms, meals and other amenities to make the best decision for yourselves. The information provided on the site relating to mapping and distances is provided for informational purposes only and is not a guarantee or warranty of any kind by GotoBus of the location of the hotel. Requests for specific features (i.e. non-smoking facility, bedding type) are not guaranteed by GotoBus or Supplier. You acknowledge that the availability of the facilities and features listed for each hotel are under the direct control of the hotel and as such GotoBus or its affiliates cannot be held responsible if those facilities or features are not made available to you during the period of your stay. Rates, Taxes, &amp; Service Fees
 The Supplier, not the GotoBus, is the vendor of your travel inventory. The Supplier, as vendor, collects and remits taxes including but not limited to sales and use taxes, value added tax, excise tax, facility taxes, and other imposed taxes to the applicable tax authorities. GotoBus is not a vendor or co-vendor associated with the Supplier. The service charge imposed by GotoBus on your reservation is retained by GotoBus solely to service and fulfill your reservation requests. Rates are only guaranteed after receipt by GotoBus of full payment and issuing of confirmation with ticket confirmation number(s). Rates and schedules are subject to change without notice prior to payment and acceptance of your offer to purchase. Generally, restrictions apply to children and minors traveling alone, and Suppliers' rules may forbid such travel. It is your obligation to check the information on the site before making a reservation for an individual traveling alone who is under the age of 21. Fees assessed by payers' credit card processor, including international credit card transactions fees, will not be refunded by GotoBus. Note that GotoBus may use credit card processors that process the credit card payment transaction outside your local area. Payments
 You must be 18 years of age and capable of legally entering into a binding contract to make a payment for travel inventory on the site. With the exception of group services, reservations must be paid in full by credit card at the time of reservation. GotoBus reserves the right to automatically charge the credit card upon acceptance of your offer to purchase travel inventory. GotoBus reserves the right to re-invoice in the event of clerical errors. GotoBus follows generally accepted practices for processing payments using credit cards. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more detailed information regarding how we protect your personal information. Cancellations, Exchanges, &amp; Complaints Once GotoBus sends you a confirmation of your purchase, a minimum cancellation fee shall apply. The applicable cancellation policies of service will be disclosed during the booking process and prior to your final approval of the reservation. All cancellations and complaints must be made directly to GotoBus using GotoBus's numbers provided on your eTicket and as follows: 617-354-2101. All complaints must be made when you know or should have known of the matter raised; generally, all complaints should be made at the start of or during consumption of the travel inventory. All complaints that are not made at the start of or during consumption of the travel inventory purchased shall be made as follows: either by calling GotoBus customer service center at 617-354-2101 OR by contacting GotoBus's customer service center by email at support@GotoBus.com. A complaint will be considered to be timely if you make the complaint when you know or should know of the matter relating to the complaint, provided however, all complaints must be submitted to GotoBus in writing no later than 30 days after end of service or, if travel inventory was not consumed, reserved start date. The request must include the return of all issued documentation. Untimely requests for refunds or compensation will not be reviewed. Cancellation requests and complaints made directly to the Supplier will not be reviewed by GotoBus. Refunds and No Shows
 Timely requests for refunds that were not satisfactorily addressed in real time must be submitted to GotoBus in writing no later than 30 days after end of service, end of service means the final date of consumption of travel inventory, or if travel service was not consumed, reserved start date. Requests for refunds after this time period will not be reviewed. If you fail to check into your hotel on the day of your reservation and do not advise GotoBus and hotel of the same, the remaining portion of your reservation may be cancelled without further notice. Unless specified otherwise in your reservation, you may not receive a refund for all or part of your reservation. No refunds or exchanges will be made for any unused, complimentary components of travel service. No refunds will be provided for lost, destroyed or stolen documents or tickets. GotoBus reserves the right to determine whether to provide a refund for consumed travel products. All refunds are subject to the above provisions governing cancellations and changes, including applicable fees, and are further subject to any such fees or other charges imposed by Suppliers. No refunds will be awarded if GotoBus is charged for the travel service. Acceptance of a refund constitutes a waiver by the customer of all rights and remedies under applicable law other than the amount of the refund. Accepted Use of Site

ALL TRAVEL SERVICES AND DOCUMENTS ISSUED ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIED BY SUPPLIERS. All content on the site is subject to amendment without notice. All content is published in good faith but EasternShuttle does not check the accuracy of all information provided by Suppliers. EasternShuttle corrects errors and omissions upon learning of the same. EasternShuttle reserves the right to cancel a reservation, without liability or penalty to you, if an error or omission leads to a material and unreasonable outcome (i.e. a five star hotel sold for ). You must confirm the Supplier's ability to meet special needs requests such as wheelchair accessible rooms directly with the Supplier. You should confirm this information immediately after confirmation of a reservation by EasternShuttle. The site provides an invitation to you to make an offer to purchase travel inventory. EasternShuttle is not making an offer to sell any travel inventory by providing access to the travel inventory to you on the site. You make an offer to purchase travel inventory when you complete all of the following: read our Terms and Conditions, click on I have read and agree with the Terms &amp; Conditions stated above to indicate your approval and understanding of our Terms and Conditions, and click on Complete My Order to finalize the offer to purchase the reservation. EasternShuttle is free to accept or reject your offer to purchase. EasternShuttle's acceptance or rejection of your offer occurs when notice of the same leaves GotoBus¡¯s email service. Upon acceptance of your offer, EasternShuttle will charge the entire payment owed, including applicable taxes and service fees when applicable, to the credit card that you provided to EasternShuttle. Reservations depend on availability of travel products and are subject to confirmation upon payment. You must ensure that the information that you provide to EasternShuttle when making a reservation is accurate. You must inform EasternShuttle of any relevant changes to your contact information and/or other relevant changes to the information that you provided to EasternShuttle at the time of the reservation. The information provided on the site relating to mapping and distances is provided for informational purposes only and is not a guarantee or warranty of any kind by EasternShuttle. Bus Tickets
 Your purchase of bus tickets is not accepted and confirmed until EasternShuttle sends an email, including ticket confirmation numbers, advising of the confirmation of the reservation and receipt of payment in full. All bus ticket purchases are non-refundable and non-transferable. Bus ticket purchases may, under certain circumstances, be exchanged prior to departure subject to payment of processing fees, any increases in fare, and similar surcharges which will be assessed at the time of the exchange. Changes to and cancellations of bus tickets can be made only if the Supplier and specific bus ticket rules permit the same. With the exception of self rescheduling online, EasternShuttle will charge a $5.00 processing fee per ticket for each change or cancellation request made through EasternShuttle's customer service agent by phone/email/fax. This processing fee will be charged in addition to the fee assessed by the Supplier. In addition, any increase in fare will be applicable. The processing fee may appear as a separate charge from EasternShuttle on the credit card statement. All approved changes and cancellations will be confirmed by an email confirmation notice from EasternShuttle. Rates, Taxes, &amp; Service Fees
 The Supplier, not the EasternShuttle, is the vendor of your travel inventory. The Supplier, as vendor, collects and remits taxes including but not limited to sales and use taxes, value added tax, excise tax, facility taxes, and other imposed taxes to the applicable tax authorities. EasternShuttle is not a vendor or co-vendor associated with the Supplier. The service charge imposed by EasternShuttle on your reservation is retained by EasternShuttle solely to service and fulfill your reservation requests. Rates are only guaranteed after receipt by EasternShuttle of full payment and issuing of confirmation with ticket confirmation number(s). Rates and schedules are subject to change without notice prior to payment and acceptance of your offer to purchase. Generally, restrictions apply to children and minors traveling alone, and Suppliers' rules may forbid such travel. It is your obligation to check the information on the site before making a reservation for an individual traveling alone who is under the age of 21.

With the exception of group services, reservations must be paid in full by credit card at the time of reservation.

EasternShuttle reserves the right to re-invoice in the event of clerical errors. EasternShuttle follows generally accepted practices for processing payments using credit cards. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more detailed information regarding how we protect your personal information. Cancellations, Exchanges, &amp; Complaints
 Once EasternShuttle sends you a confirmation of your purchase, a minimum cancellation fee shall apply. The applicable cancellation policies of service will be disclosed during the booking process and prior to your final approval of the reservation. All cancellations and complaints must be made directly to EasternShuttle using EasternShuttle's numbers provided on your eTicket and as follows: 617-354-2101. All complaints must be made when you know or should have known of the matter raised; generally, all complaints should be made at the start of or during consumption of the travel inventory. All complaints that are not made at the start of or during consumption of the travel inventory purchased shall be made as follows: either by calling GotoBus¡¯s customer service center at 617-354-2101 OR by contacting EasternShuttle's customer service center by email at support@EasternShuttle.com. A complaint will be considered to be timely if you make the complaint when you know or should know of the matter relating to the complaint, provided however, all complaints must be submitted to EasternShuttle in writing no later than 30 days after end of service or, if travel inventory was not consumed, reserved start date. The request must include the return of all issued documentation. Untimely requests for refunds or compensation will not be reviewed. Cancellation requests and complaints made directly to the Supplier will not be reviewed by EasternShuttle. Refunds and No Shows
 Timely requests for refunds that were not satisfactorily addressed in real time must be submitted to EasternShuttle in writing no later than 30 days after end of service, end of service means the final date of consumption of travel inventory, or if travel service was not consumed, reserved start date.

Unless specified otherwise in your reservation, you may not receive a refund for all or part of your reservation. No refunds or exchanges will be made for any unused, complimentary components of travel service. No refunds will be provided for lost, destroyed or stolen documents or tickets. EasternShuttle reserves the right to determine whether to provide a refund for consumed travel products. All refunds are subject to the above provisions governing cancellations and changes, including applicable fees, and are further subject to any such fees or other charges imposed by Suppliers. No refunds will be awarded if EasternShuttle is charged for the travel service.

    <string name="content_expect">No frills service-the driver may be the ticket collector; there will not be a lot of customer service. Comfortable buses. Despite the low fares buses are usually quite nice. Most buses are comparable to Greyhound and many are actually more deluxe. Communication challenges. Drivers are legally required to speak enough English to help passengers in the case of emergency. In reality this is often adhered to rather loosely. At the very least, expect your driver to have an accent. Possible delays. Many of these bus routes are on highly congested roads. When the roads are busy, expect delays. Rest stops. Buses will have a lavatory on board but there is usually a 10 or 15 minute bathroom break on trips over 4 hours. Don’t be late returning to the bus, the driver will not count heads before leaving at the appointed time. Full buses. Buses definitely sell out at peak times (weekends and evenings). Book ahead or get there early if you want secure a seat. Plastic Bags. An odd little quirk on Chinatown buses is that every aisle seat usually has a plastic grocery bag tied to the arm. I guess they find this is the best way to keep the buses clean.</string>
    <string name="content_history">In the late 1990s a few entrepreneurs in New York’s Chinatown started running buses from Chinatown in NY to Chinatown in Boston for less than half of what traditional bus companies were charging and a fraction of what it cost to take the train or fly. Their target market was Asian immigrants who wanted to shop or visit relatives and needed cheap and convenient transportation. Although the buses were modern and comfortable, the service was bare bones-no advertising, customer service, or bus stations. Customers simply went to the bus stop, waited for the bus, and paid the driver upon boarding. For those willing to do without frills, these companies offered virtually the same service as Greyhound at a substantially lower price. Before long, word spread about the service and all kinds of travelers started using the service. It became especially popular with students, budget travelers, or people for whom the service was simply more convenient. Soon more bus companies duplicated this model and started offering service in other markets. Now you can find this type of bus service in Philadelphia, Virginia, Washington DC, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At this point the term Chinatown bus is used more loosely to describe this sort of low-cost/low-frills service. Many, if not most of the company’s do not have Chinatown as there main location and may not cater to the immigrant population at all. These operators are also sometimes referred to as curbside operators.</string>
    <string name="content_safe">When these companies first started operating, concerns were raised about safety standards. There is still controversy within the bus industry about whether these newcomers are complying with the same regulations as the traditional companies. Nonetheless, all bus companies operating in the U.S. must all undergo the same inspection standards and must comply with the same rules. As in any industry there is a range of quality among bus carriers. Some are fly-by-night operators that try to cut corners while others are legitimate entrepreneurs who plan to grow and operate a long term business. Check out the News to see get the inside scoop on different bus companies.</string>
    <string name="content_why_cheap">There are a few fundamental differences between the way Chinatown bus companies and traditional bus companies run their operations. Most Chinatown operators run small, streamlined operations and only offer basic service. First, most of these operators do not have formal stations; instead they pickup passengers at bus stops. Second, they eschew traditional advertising in favor of word of mouth buzz. Third, many of the operators play a very hands-on role in the operation-there are no overpaid executives at a small independent bus company. Finally, and perhaps the most important factor, is that these operators make sure they fill their buses. That tend to serve only on heavily trafficked routes.</string>
