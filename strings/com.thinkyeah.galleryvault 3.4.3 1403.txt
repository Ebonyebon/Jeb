This information may include the following: geo-location, Your IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device manufacturer and type, device and hardware settings, ID for advertising, ads data, operating system, operator, IMSI, connection information, usage statistics, device log and event information, the number of incoming &amp; outgoing calls and other information based on your interaction with our Services.</string>
    <string name="a8o">"Please note: the app will never upload and store your contacts and your call history.
The app accesses the contacts on the phone in order to display the contacts and so the app can record or ignore calls from specific contacts. While we are intensity focused on protecting you from unknown calls, we are just as concerned with making sure important calls are not missed. Access to contacts helps us filter out numbers that may look spam, but are actually legitimate (like your Doctor’s office). We also access contacts to identity callers under the name you prefer to see, to enable your ability to add numbers to your blocklist."</string>
    <string name="a8p">You can tag an unknown number after making a call. So this contribution will make our database better. We may also associate a name with a phone number through the numbers tagging functionality, which allows a user who receives a call from a phone number which is not associated with a name in the database to indicate a name to be associated with that number. A name will only be associated with a number through this functionality if a sufficient number of independent Users, based on our algorithm, have indicated the same name for the relevant number.</string>
