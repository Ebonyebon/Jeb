The Thenx website is provided by Calisthenics Online, LLC hereinafter referred to as 'Thenx'. This data protection declaration provides information on how we use and protect your data on the Thenx website. Using the Thenx website implies that you accept the terms set forth in this data protection declaration. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Thenx website. This data protection declaration applies to all members from the time they first log in at Thenx, thereby acknowledging acceptance of this data protection declaration.


I General


The concept of the Thenx online platform and mobile apps and network relies to a great extent on the publication of information regarding individual users to other users by making them accessible via the Thenx mobile application. All users can freely access the public profile information (picture, first name, last name and location), training information (workout times and repetitions) and network information (followings and followers) of all other users. Thenx application users do not have the option to change that. Also, names and training information of users will be used for Thenx leaderboards inside the application that can be displayed by all users.
By using the application, users explicitly consent that other users may see the information named above and it may be used for Thenx leaderboards.
If users do not want other users to get access to their information, they have to leave their profile empty and they have to make sure to not save any workouts. If they accidentally do so, they have to delete them in their profile.
Email addresses will not be shared with any other user unless made publically available via a users profile intentionally.
They may, however, be automatically added to the Thenx mailing lists. From time to time Thenx may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.


II Types of personally identifiable information collected by Thenx


Thenx collects different types of personally identifiable information from their users upon registration and in connection with the usage of the Thenx application. The personally identifiable information collected by Thenx belongs to the following categories.


•\u0009Profile information which users can freely enter, change and delete via settings such as: first name and last name, location, gender

•\u0009Training information that will be stored when users save performances such as: workout times for strength and cardio workouts, exercise repetitions for MAX workouts, and comments

•\u0009Network information that are generated when users are following or are being followed by other users such as: followers, followings, comments, and likes

•\u0009Email addresses
Personal identifiable information shall be saved and used in particular to offer new applications to the members, to improve such applications and adapt them to the users needs.


III Use and sharing of personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties


By registering, the user explicitly agrees that Thenx shall have the right to use all automatically collected personally identifiable information for purposes of the Thenx application and future web services. Thenx does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer users personally identifiable information (see section II above) to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our application and conducting our business, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. Thenx may also release users information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. Thenx may also pass personal identifiable information to third parties if the user explicitly gives permission.
Thenx implements all reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access by third parties to saved details.
However, Thenx assumes no liability for the interception, alteration, or misuse of the information you provide other users by other users.
The user explicitly consents that Thenx may provide non-personally identifiable information to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.


IV Facebook Integration


The Thenx application integrates different connection to the social network Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. They are used to share activities on Facebook and to get Facebook information about Thenx application users. An overview of Facebook integrations and social plugins can be found here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
When users enable the Facebook connection, the Facebook integration establishes a connection between a user and the Facebook server. Thereby, Thenx receives information about the user. This information will be treated as stated in section III.
When users invite friends via Facebook, the Facebook integration establishes a connection between a user and the Facebook server. That allows the user to gain information about his or her friends via the Thenx application. Thenx as the provider of the Thenx application does not receive any of this information.
When users share their performances on Facebook and when they invite friends via Facebook, the Facebook integration establishes a connection between a user and the Facebook server. Thereby, the user links information of his Thenx account to his or her Facebook account. That allows Facebook to correlate a user’s usage of the Thenx application with the corresponding users Facebook account. Thenx as the provider of the Thenx application does not have any knowledge of the future data usage by Facebook. Users can find more information on that issue in the privacy policy of Facebook at: http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.
Users have to actively enable the Facebook connection in their settings in order to be able to share performances on Facebook and invite friends via Facebook. If users do not want Facebook to gain information on their Thenx application usage or if they don’t want Thenx to gain information about them via Facebook, they shall leave the Facebook integration disabled as it is in the default settings. Once enabled, users can disable the Facebook connection again in their Settings at any time.
By activating the Facebook connection in his or her settings, the user explicitly consents to the information exchange described in this section.
