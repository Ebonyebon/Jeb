Women experience contractions in &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_labor-what-it-feels-like_10339941.bc'>all kinds of ways&lt;/a>, ranging from cramping to tightening, burning, backache, and more. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/stages-of-labor'>When you’re in true labor&lt;/a>, contractions get progressively longer, stronger, more painful, and closer together.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Our contraction timer will help you keep track of what you’re experiencing. When a contraction begins, press “Start contraction,” and when it ends, press “Stop contraction.” We’ll record the info for you and calculate the length of your contractions and the time between them – and the averages, too.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Typically, when you’re having your first baby, your doctor or midwife will want you to call once you’ve spent at least one hour having contractions that come five minutes apart and last one minute each. But your caregiver might have different instructions for you, so discuss the plan ahead of time.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Keep in mind that if your &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_water-breaking-what-it-feels-like_10339934.bc'>water breaks&lt;/a> during the early part of labor, things may progress quickly from there. Notify your caregiver right away.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>If this isn’t your first baby, you’ve experienced a fast labor before, or you’re already somewhat dilated and effaced, you may need to notify your caregiver as soon as you begin to have painful contractions."</string>

    <string name="feeding_content_breast_milk_1">"This is a common question for new breastfeeding moms because you can't see how much milk your nursing baby is actually getting. Signs your baby is getting enough:"</string>
    <string name="feeding_content_breast_milk_2">"&lt;br>&lt;br>Worries that your baby's getting too little: &lt;br>&lt;br>Most moms can provide their babies with all the milk they need, but there are times when babies don't get enough. If this happens, a baby can suffer from &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_dehydration-in-babies_11527.bc'>dehydration&lt;/a> and &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_failure-to-gain-weight-in-babies_1621.bc'>failure to thrive&lt;/a> – conditions that are uncommon, but serious. &lt;br>&lt;br>Watch for these signs if you're concerned about your newborn's milk intake:"</string>
    <string name="feeding_content_breast_milk_3">"&lt;br>&lt;br>If you're concerned that your baby isn't getting enough milk, don't hesitate to call your baby's doctor or check in with a nurse or lactation consultant. &lt;br>&lt;br>Learn more:"</string>
    <string name="feeding_content_formula_1">"It can be tricky to figure out how much formula to give your baby. Is he getting too much or too little? How much is enough? The answers depend mostly on how much your baby weighs and how he's growing. &lt;br>&lt;br>How much formula by weight: &lt;br>&lt;br>Before age 4 to 6 months, when your baby isn't &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_introducing-solid-food_113.bc'>eating any solids&lt;/a>, here's a simple rule of thumb: Offer 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight each day. &lt;br>&lt;br>For example, if your baby weighs 6 pounds, you'll give her about 15 ounces of formula in a 24-hour period. If she weighs 10 pounds, you'll give her about 25 ounces in a 24-hour period. &lt;br>&lt;br>These numbers are not rigid rules. They give you an overall average for what your baby is likely to require. Daily feedings will vary according to his individual needs – in other words, he may want a bit more on some days and a bit less on others. &lt;br>&lt;br>Weight isn't the only consideration. Learn &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-tell-how-much-formula-your-baby-needs_9136.bc'>your baby's hunger cues&lt;/a> and remember that &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-tell-how-much-formula-your-baby-needs_9136.bc'>babies' needs change as they get older&lt;/a>. &lt;br>&lt;br>Signs your baby is getting enough formula:"</string>
    <string name="feeding_content_formula_2">"&lt;br>&lt;br>Worries that your baby's getting too much or too little: &lt;br>&lt;br>If you're worried that your baby is getting too little or too much formula, talk with his doctor. The doctor can check your baby's weight and growth, tell you whether your baby's intake is appropriate for his size and age, and advise you about any adjustments you may need to make. &lt;br>&lt;br>Learn more:"</string>

Try to count kicks around the same time every day. If you notice a major change, call your health provider. If you don't reach 10 movements in two hours, try to perk up your baby by eating a snack, drinking something cold, or walking around. Wait an hour and count kicks again. If you still don't reach 10 in two hours, call your provider.

Why count kicks?
Getting to know your baby's movement pattern can help you catch a problem early and may reduce the risk of stillbirth. Some practitioners advise starting daily kick counts at 28 weeks (or sooner if you have a high-risk pregnancy). There are lots of different methods for doing a kick count, so find out what your practitioner recommends."</string>

He recommends following a warm, loving &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_establishing-a-bedtime-routine-with-your-baby_1507759.bc'>bedtime routine&lt;/a> and then putting your baby in bed awake and leaving him (even if he cries) for gradually longer periods of time. Putting a child to bed awake, says Ferber, is crucial to teaching him to go to sleep on his own. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>How to try it:&lt;br>&lt;br>First, wait until your baby is physically and emotionally ready to sleep through the night, usually between 4 and 6 months of age. If you're not sure whether your baby's ready, you can give it a try or discuss it with your child's doctor. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>1.&lt;/b> Put your baby in his crib when he's sleepy but still awake. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>2.&lt;/b> Say goodnight to your child and leave the room. If he cries when you leave, let him cry for a predetermined amount of time – for example, three minutes. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>3.&lt;/b> Go back into the room for no more than a minute or two to pat and reassure your baby. Leave the light off and keep your voice quiet and soothing. Don't pick him up. Leave again while he's still awake, even if he's crying. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>4.&lt;/b> Stay out of the room for a little bit longer than the first time and follow the same routine, staying out of the room for gradually longer intervals, each time returning for only a minute or two to pat and reassure him, and leaving while he's still awake. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>5.&lt;/b> Follow this routine until your child falls asleep when you're out of the room. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>6.&lt;/b> If your child wakes up again later, follow the same routine, beginning with the minimum waiting time for that night and gradually increasing the intervals between visits until you reach the maximum for that night. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>7.&lt;/b> Increase the amount of time between visits to the nursery each night. In most cases, according to Ferber, your baby will be going to sleep on his own by the third or fourth night – a week at the most. If your child is very resistant after several nights of trying, wait a few weeks and then try again. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Find out more: &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-training-cry-it-out-methods_1497112.bc'>\"Cry it out\" methods&lt;/a>"</string>
    <string name="sleep_method_content_happiest_baby">"&lt;h1>The \"Happiest Baby\" technique&lt;/h1> &lt;br>At the heart of pediatrician Harvey Karp's method for soothing crying or fussy infants and getting them to sleep are the so-called five S's: swaddle, side or stomach position, shush, swing, and suck – most effective for babies under 4 months old. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>How to try it: &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>1. Swaddle&lt;/b> &lt;br>&lt;br>Swaddle your baby for sleep every time, whether it's a morning nap or going down for the night. Always lay your baby down to sleep on her back – never on her side or tummy. To avoid overheating, use a thin blanket and make sure the room isn't too warm. &lt;br>&lt;br>Swaddling isn't hard, but you need to use the proper technique to make sure it'll be safe and effective. &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/2_how-to-swaddle-a-baby_10347122.bc'>Watch a doctor demonstrate the simple art of swaddling&lt;/a>, see a &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/how-to-swaddle-your-baby-gallery'>how-to-swaddle slideshow&lt;/a>, or read our &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_swaddling-your-baby_125.bc'>article&lt;/a>. You'll be an expert in no time! &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>2. Side or stomach position&lt;/b> &lt;br>&lt;br>Hold your fussing or crying baby in your arms in a side or tummy-down position in your arms or on your lap, or place him over your shoulder. Use this \"S\" only for soothing your infant. Never put him on his side or stomach when he's asleep. Once he falls asleep, put him on his back. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>3. Shush&lt;/b> &lt;br>&lt;br>Holding your swaddled baby on her side or tummy, put your lips right next to her ear and \"shhh\" loudly (usually while gently jiggling her – see \"S\" #4). &lt;br>&lt;br>Shush as loudly as your baby is crying. As she calms down, lower the volume of your shushing to match. &lt;br>&lt;br>Karp also recommends play a recording of white noise while your baby sleeps. He says that fans, sound machines, and recordings of ocean waves may not work, and recommends sounds that are more low and \"rumbly\" (like the sounds in the womb) such as those on his own &lt;i>Super-Soothing Calming Sounds&lt;/i> CD. &lt;br>&lt;br>Play the sounds as loud as your baby is crying to calm her down. To accompany sleep, play them as loud as a shower. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>4. Swing&lt;/b> &lt;br>&lt;br>Do this while shushing (or playing white noise to) your swaddled baby in a side or stomach position. Support your newborn's head and gently jiggle – do not shake – your baby. Karp describes it as more of a \"shiver\" than a shake, moving back and forth no more than an inch in any direction. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>5. Suck&lt;/b> &lt;br>&lt;br>Give your swaddled baby a pacifier or your thumb if he's upset and seems to want to suck. Pacifiers reduce the risk of SIDS, so it's okay to let your baby keep the pacifier in bed. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Find out more: &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_harvey-karps-happiest-baby-method-for-baby-sleep-and-soothin_10373838.bc'>The \"Happiest Baby\" technique&lt;/a>"</string>
    <string name="sleep_method_content_night_weaning_1">"&lt;h1>Night weaning&lt;/h1> &lt;br>What it is: &lt;br>&lt;br>If your baby's at least 4 to 6 months old, you can probably begin to wean her from nighttime feedings. Of course, even if your baby doesn't need to eat in the middle of the night, she may still wake up wanting to. Babies who are used to eating several times a night tend to wake up out of habit, and it can take time to change this routine. &lt;br>&lt;br>It's hard to maintain your own health and well-being if you're chronically sleep deprived. So the decision to end to your baby's night feeding depends in part on how it's affecting you. &lt;br>&lt;br>If you enjoy nursing or giving a bottle to your baby at night, there's no reason to stop – she'll eventually quit on her own. On the other hand, if you find yourself feeling grumpy and exhausted – and your baby's physically ready for the change – maybe it's time. &lt;br>&lt;br>If you're not sure whether your baby's ready, talk to your child's doctor. The doctor can help you sort through all the issues and help you make your decision based on how your baby's growing. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>How to try it:&lt;br>"</string>

    <string name="sleep_schedule_content_baby_led">"&lt;h1>Baby-led schedules&lt;/h1> &lt;br>Baby-led schedules are an undefined kind of routine. You follow your baby's lead, meaning you'll look for his cues to decide what he needs next rather than imposing a timetable for feedings, rest, or play. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>This doesn't mean your days will be totally unpredictable: After the first few weeks, most babies form their own fairly regular patterns of sleeping, playing, and eating. But the schedule may vary from day to day depending on the signals he's giving you. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>How to try it: &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>First, make sure your baby's basic needs for food, sleep, and interaction are met. Your days may look different, but there will be consistency in these three elements. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Spend lots of time holding and observing your baby to learn her cues. Does she put her hand in her mouth or thrust her tongue out when she's hungry? Does she rub her eyes and get fussy when she's ready for a nap? Attentive parents usually learn all these signals as they get to know their babies – but if you're following a baby-led schedule, you'll need to be an especially keen student of your baby's behavior. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Many parents who gravitate toward baby-led schedules appreciate the advice of pediatrician William Sears and his wife, registered nurse Martha Sears. The couple's \"attachment parenting\" approach involves creating a close bond by &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/2_baby-wearing-how-carriers-help-you-and-your-baby_1486841.bc'>wearing your baby close to your body&lt;/a>, &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/breastfeeding-basics'>breastfeeding&lt;/a> frequently to provide nourishment and comfort, and &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-sharing-the-family-bed_7753.bc'>sharing a family bed&lt;/a>. (They're careful to point out that none of these things is absolutely necessary to a successful baby-led routine, however.)  The Searses urge parents to follow their baby's lead when it comes to sleep. It's normal for babies to wake two to three times a night from birth until age 6 months, and one or two times a night from 6 to 12 months old, they say. So instead of making &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/408_when-can-my-baby-start-sleeping-through-the-night_1368534.bc'>sleeping through the night&lt;/a> the goal, parents should focus on helping babies develop \"a healthy sleep attitude\". &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>\"It helps to realize that some babies are easy sleepers who are born knowing how to soothe themselves, while other babies wake easily at night and are hard to settle back to sleep,\" they write. \"Every baby is different and sleep behavior has more to do with inborn temperament than with any ad habits' caused by Mom or Dad.\" &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Find out more: &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-led-baby-schedules-sears-spock-and-others_3658355.bc'>Baby-led schedules&lt;/a>"</string>
    <string name="sleep_schedule_content_combo">"&lt;h1>Combination schedules&lt;/h1> &lt;br>Combination schedules bring together elements of baby- and parent-led methods. With this approach, you have a timetable for when your baby will eat, sleep, play, and so on, and you'll generally stick to a similar pattern every day. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>But you have more flexibility than with a strictly parent-led routine. A nap can be pushed back if your baby doesn't seem tired yet, and lunch can be postponed if a trip to the store takes longer than expected. Well-known advocates of this style include the late Tracy Hogg and \"Supernanny\" Jo Frost. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>How to try it: &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Often, parents who opt for a schedule that's both baby-led and parent-led look to many sources for inspiration. Books, parenting classes, your baby's doctor, family and friends, and moms and dads in your &lt;a href='https://community.babycenter.com/groups/topic/1/birth_clubs'>BabyCenter birth club&lt;/a> can all help you figure out a routine that works for you and your baby. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Pediatrician Marc Weissbluth's &lt;i>Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child&lt;/i> is one book that has helped many parents develop a combination routine. He provides general schedules to help foster healthy sleep patterns, but mostly focuses on the parents' role in helping their baby develop the self-soothing skills needed to sleep well. The idea is that when your baby's well rested, the remainder of the day – eating, playing, and so on – will fall into place. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Weissbluth's method is all about timing &lt;i>and&lt;/i> learning how to recognize your baby's signals that he's ready for rest. In the book, he teaches parents how to spot these sleep signals and \"catch the rising wave of sleepiness before the child crashes into an overtired state.\" &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>The techniques of \"baby whisperer\" Tracy Hogg, who died in 2004, also provide a middle-ground approach. Her popular baby-care book, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer, encourages parents to keep a consistent routine, but not one that has to be exactly the same every day. Hogg's E.A.S.Y. method – having your baby Eat, do an Activity, then Sleep (always in that order) – was designed to create a content, happy baby and a nice chunk of time for You. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Find out more: &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_combination-baby-schedules-supernanny-baby-whisperer-and-oth_3658358.bc'>Combination baby schedules&lt;/a>"</string>
    <string name="sleep_schedule_content_parent_led">"&lt;h1>Parent-led schedules&lt;/h1> &lt;br>Parent-led schedules are strict. They may specify exactly when (and sometimes how much) your baby will eat, when he'll sleep and for how long, when he'll play or go out, and so on. The schedule may be one you create based on your baby's natural patterns or a suggested routine from an expert, but once it's set, it's very consistent – even down to the minute – from day to day. Well-known advocates of this style include British nurse Gina Ford and Gary Ezzo, author of &lt;i>On Becoming Baby Wise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep&lt;/i>. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Note: Ask your doctor before trying this with a new baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns against structured feeding routines for newborns – which some parent-led schedulers recommends, in part as a way of helping babies sleep through night early on. The AAP advises feeding newborns on demand, whenever they show signs of hunger. The general AAP guideline is that newborns should nurse eight to 12 times in 24 hours and should be fed at least every four hours, even if it means waking them up. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>How to try it: &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>The key is to create a schedule. Advocates of parent-led schedules emphasize adhering to the schedule exactly every day to make sure it \"takes.\" Everything happens at a predetermined time: Wake-up time, naps, meals, play time, baths and evening routine, bedtime, and so on. The routine changes as your baby gets older, but it's always clearly defined. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Ford's &lt;i>The New Contented Little Baby Book&lt;/i> gives exact, hour-by-hour schedules to follow as soon as your baby is 1 week old. She discourages parents from getting even a half hour off the schedule: \"Half an hour can have a knock-on effect which disrupts the rest of your day and, possibly, your night.\" &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Ford emphasizes structured feedings from the start, saying that carefully planned daytime feedings help babies sleep through the night sooner. Don't follow her advice unless your baby is thriving and your doctor gives you the go-ahead. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Ezzo, in contrast, offers fairly moderate advice on scheduling feedings – he's more like an advocate of &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_combination-baby-schedules-supernanny-baby-whisperer-and-oth_3658358.bc'>combination schedules&lt;/a> in this regard. To get into a feeding routine, Ezzo says, ignore the clock during the first seven to 10 days of your baby's life and just focus on your baby getting full feedings at every nursing session. Do this, Ezzo says, and your baby will naturally fall into a pattern of eating every two and a half to three hours (from the start of one feeding to the start of the next). &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>At this point, his \"parent-directed feeding\" method advises looking to the schedule and to your baby's hunger cues to know when to feed – but your baby's hunger cues take precedence. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Like \"Baby Whisperer\" Tracy Hogg, a &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_combination-baby-schedules-supernanny-baby-whisperer-and-oth_3658358.bc'>combination scheduler&lt;/a>, Ezzo recommends getting your baby used to a consistent pattern of feeding first, then wake time, then nap time – always in that order. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>If you're not sure you want to follow a rigid schedule and your baby is gaining weight appropriately, some doctors recommend transitioning from a baby-led to a parent-led schedule by taking a more gradual approach. You can do this by increasing the number of hours between feedings every week – one hour at a time – until you're feeding regularly at least every 3 hours. For example, the first week you feed every hour, the second week every two hours, and the third week every three hours. &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>Find out more: &lt;a href='https://www.babycenter.com/0_parent-led-baby-schedules-baby-wise-gina-ford-and-others_3658361.bc'>Parent-led schedules&lt;/a>"</string>
