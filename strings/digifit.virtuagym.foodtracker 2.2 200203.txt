    <string name="this_week">This week</string>
    <string name="time_frame">Time Frame</string>
    <string name="tip1">A calorie is not a compound, but a unit of energy. In nutrition, calories are often used to measure energy density in food. Any nutritious food provides you with energy, and thus contains calories!</string>
    <string name="tip10">Fish is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, essential acids for your body that help protect you against heart and coronary diseases. The fattier the fish, the more omega-3 acids.</string>
    <string name="tip11">"Chips never look better than when you're hungry. So, don't go grocery shopping when you have an appetite. If you shop on a full stomach, you won't have any cravings and you'll be less inclined to buy (unhealthy) snacks. This way, you can focus on buying healthy products."</string>
    <string name="tip12">"In the morning, you haven't eaten anything for 8 to 12 hours. Breakfast puts your digestive system to work and benefits bowel movement. Breakfast boosts concentration, and prevents you from snacking later in the morning."</string>
    <string name="tip13">"Fibers are the parts of plant foods that our bodies can't break down. Fiber isn't digested by your body and therefore don't supply our bodies with energy. Instead, they are necessary for the proper functioning of your intestines and digestive tract."</string>
    <string name="tip14">"Protein are building blocks for our bodies - they're everywhere, responsible for the growth and maintenance of our muscles, but also for hair growth, for example. Every diet should contain plenty of protein to keep the body working in good order."</string>
    <string name="tip15">"Great sources of protein are meat and fish. Vegetarian options are rice and beans, soy, quinoa, seitan, quorn and nuts. Protein is very satiating compared to fats or carbs, meaning it'll fill you up quicker."</string>
    <string name="tip16">"If you are looking to build muscle, you're going to need more protein than normal. After all, you can't build a wall without bricks. Try to eat at least 1.5 grams of proteins per pound of bodyweight."</string>
    <string name="tip17">"You can't underestimate the importance of water. It transports nutrients in our bodies, and it helps get waste out. It helps us to stay cool. Moreover, drinking water fills you up - you'll be less hungry. Great if you're trying to lose weight!"</string>
    <string name="tip18">"Sometimes it's hard to know what to log - when you're eating at a restaurant, for example. In that case, always try to log what you can. If you had pasta with chicken, at least log pasta and chicken. This way, you'll have an indication of your consumption that day, even if you don't know exactly what that delicious sauce was."</string>
    <string name="tip19">"Your daily recommended dose of salt is about 6 grams (and even that's on the high end). A bit of salt is necessary, but too much salt can lead to oedema, high blood pressure, heart- and coronary disease, kidney damage and osteoporosis."</string>
    <string name="tip2">Different macronutrients provide us with different levels of energy. Carbs and proteins provide 4 calories per gram, while fat provides 9 calories per gram.</string>
    <string name="tip20">"You don't have to cut out all the things you enjoy. Pick a small vice to continue through your diet. It might be an evening glass of wine, a weekly ice cream, or a small piece of chocolate every day. A long-term diet is about moderation!"</string>
    <string name="tip21">"Too little fiber can lead to intestinal problems, like constipation. Moreover, because fiber fills you up but isn't absorbed by the body, eating plenty of fiber can help prevent weight gain!"</string>
    <string name="tip22">Your body needs all kinds of nutrients to remain healthy and fit. For instance, carbs give you energy, proteins maintain your muscle, and fats help with nutrient absorption. Never cut out a macronutrient completely!</string>
    <string name="tip24">"If you think you're eating too much in one sitting, try using a smaller plate. This will force you to eat smaller portions. Also, don't eat in front of the TV - it's easy to lose track how much you're eating when you're focussed on the TV. Finally, don't go back for seconds."</string>
    <string name="tip25">"Did you know 80% of our salt intake comes from processed foods? One of the most popular flavourings in the food industry is salt. This is a major factor in today's overconsumption of salt. Read the food labels!"</string>
    <string name="tip26">"Divide your meals evenly throughout the day. Don't skip the 3 main meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner. But don't ignore your body: if you're not very hungry, don't eat a huge breakfast."</string>
    <string name="tip27">"Besides your main meals, it's alright to have a couple of healthy snacks during the day. How about a banana? A handful of nuts are great as well. Just don't go for chips or muffins."</string>
    <string name="tip28">"Vegetables are low in calories, but rich in vitamins, minerals and fibers. Vegetables are good for you - that's a no-brainer. Try to eat different kinds of vegetables to get all the necessary nutrients, and try to eat at least 200 grams a day."</string>
