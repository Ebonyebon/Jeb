While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

 11 Final Provisions

 These terms of use are a binding contract between Coodriver GmbH, Dr. Maxstraße 14, 82031 Grünwald, Germany (hereinafter referred to as “Coodriver”) and you (hereinafter referred to as “You” or “User”).

 1 Scope of Application

 1.1 For the use of the Coodriver Apps “Schutzranzen – die Autofahrer-App” and the “Schutzranzen – die Kinder App” (both together hereinafter referred to as “App” or “Application”), the terms of use apply exclusively. In addition to these terms of use, the general terms and conditions of the distribution platform used for the distribution of the App (“Apple App Store”, “Google Play”, together “App Store”) apply, insofar as these relate to the processing of purchasing and the download of content. In case of inconsistencies, these terms of use have priority.

 2 Subject Matter of the Contract

 2.1 The subject matter of this contract is the provision of the Application. The app is pro-vided free of charge. Within the App you have the possibility to subscribe to additional services which are subject to a fee (e.g. additional functions, etc.).

 2.2 Coodriver makes the Application available via the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Coodriver provides no support or technical assistance for this Application. The use of the App requires a compatible device. The respective system requirements are given in the respective product page within the distribution platform. Use of the App may also be possible by devices other than those expressly listed. However the range of functions or the display may be limited, depending on the individual characteristics of the device. The use of the App is for entertainment purposes only; use for commer-cial purposes is not permitted. The Applications do not guarantee absolute safety in traffic. The User must therefore not rely upon the warning functions or missing warn-ings of the Applications. The User is responsible for complying with the duty of care re-quired by road transport at all times. The User uses the Applications at their own risk. Use of the Applications while conducting a vehicle may be prohibited according to local laws.

 3 Conclusion of the Contract, Acquisition of Virtual Goods

 3.1 The contract relating to the use of the App including the granting rights of use enters into force when the User installs the App.

 3.2 Coodriver can offer extensions within the App which are subject to a fee, such as addi-tional functions (hereinafter referred to as “In-App Purchases”).

 3.3 An agreement on an In-App Purchase expires automatically at the end of the agreed term. Both parties’ right of extraordinary termination for cause remains unaffected.

 3.4 The prices for the In-App Purchases can be found by the User in the “purchases” sec-tion of the App. All prices are gross prices and include the statutory sales tax.

 4 Obligations and Responsibilities of the User; Exemption

 4.1 The User is responsible for the regular backing up of his data.

 4.2 The App may not be put to improper use, in particular

 – the use of software for the systematic or automatic control of the Application or other functions (e.g. bots, macros, etc.), for the purposes of reproducing the software, or for the analysis of the Applications or elements of the Applications is prohibited;

 – the User is prohibited from reverse engineering the App or otherwise attempting to discover the source code of the App;

 – the User is prohibited to make use of bugs or mistakes in the programming for his own uses.

 4.3 Detected bugs should be reported as soon as possible via email to info@coodriver.com.

 4.4 The User will inform Coodriver if he knows of or discovers any improper use of the Applications by third parties or other Users. To guarantee an effective intervention, the User is requested to do this in writing (e.g. by email).

 4.5 The User agrees to indemnify and compensate Coodriver for all damages which arise from his not complying with the obligations arising under these terms of use. The User hereby takes on responsibility for the costs of the necessary legal defence of Coodriv-er, including all court and legal costs. This does not apply, insofar as the User is not responsible for the breach.

 4.6 Coodriver retains the right to lock the User’s account in the App for a breach of Clause 4.2.

 5 Rights and Obligations of Coodriver

 5.1 Coodriver retains all right, title and interest in and to the Applications. Coodriver can modify the Applications. Accordingly, the User receives only a right of use of the re-spective Application and the services in the respective current version.

 5.2 There is no claim afforded to the User for permanent use of the Application in the ver-sion which existed at the time of download. Coodriver reserves the right to suspend the operation of an Application at any time without justification. Coodriver will immediately inform the User of the suspension.

 6 Granting of Rights

 6.1 Coodriver grants You a worldwide, temporally unlimited, non-exclusive (bare), non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to use the App for personal purposes, including documentation and usage instructions contained within the App. The User can down-load and use the App exclusively on such devices which are connected to the user ac-count used for the purchase on the respective distribution platform (e.g. Apple-ID).

 6.2 Subject matter of the license is the respective current version of the Application.

 6.3 Producing copies of the App is only allowed insofar as this is necessary for the use of the App in accordance with the contract. The User is not permitted to make the App accessible to third parties, to rent or lend to another for a limited period of time. Any rights which have not been expressly granted remain reserved.

 7 Legally Required Information

 7.1 The offers of Coodriver are not binding.

 7.2 The language for the closing of the contract is exclusively English.

 8 Warranty

 8.1 THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS-IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. COODRIVER DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. COODRIVER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL MEET THE USER’S REQUIREMENTS, THE USE OF THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, ERROR-FREE, SECURE OR FREE OF VIRUSES, WORMS, DISABLING CODE OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIKE, OR THAT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE APP WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE. THE USER AGREES TO ASSUME ALL RISK OF ANY AND ALL DAMAGES AND LOSS FROM USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE APP.

 9 Liability

 9.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF COODRIVER FOR ALL DIRECT DAMAGES RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM THIS CONTRACT OR THE APP, IN THE AGGREGATE, WHETHER ARISING FROM HID’S BREACH OF THIS CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER ACTIVE, AFFIRMATIVE OR GROSS), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER TORT, OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPS OR OTHERWISE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT COODRIVER RECEIVED FROM THE USER FOR THE PARTICULAR PUCHASE GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

 9.2 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL COODRIVER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS CONTRACT OR THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE AND ANY NON-ECONOMIC LOSSES, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY ON WHICH ANY SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE BASED AND EVEN IF COODRIVER HAS BEEN ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED HEREIN.

 9.3 Without limiting the foregoing, Coodriver is not liable for damages resulting from altera-tions to the App by the User or a software or hardware environment which differs from the system requirements.

 9.4 Coodriver is furthermore not liable for damages or losses of data which may arise through the installation of software which is not provided by Coodriver on the Smartphone or other device.

 10 Right of Withdrawal

 10.1 The contract on the provision of the App is concluded gratuitously; therefore in this respect there is no right of withdrawal.

 10.2 The User has the right to withdrawal every In-App Purchase in accordance with the following cancellation policy.

 10.2.1 Cancellation Policy

 Instructions on withdrawal

 Right of withdrawal

 You have the right to withdrawal this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

 The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

 To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (Coodriver GmbH, Dr. Maxstraße 14, 82031 Grünwald, Tel.: +49-89-66066-957, Fax: +49-89-66066-958 E-Mail: info@coodriver.com) of your decision to withdrawal this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not ob-ligatory.

 To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your notification concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

 Effects of withdrawal

 If you withdrawal this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, in-cluding the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdrawal this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have ex-pressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reim-bursement.

 If you agreed that the service shall be performed within the withdrawal period, you have to pay an appropriate amount which is in proportion to the extent of the service already provided in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

 10.2.2 Special Notice

 Your right of withdrawal in relation to the digital content which forms parts of this contract shall expire early in accordance with § 356 (5) of the German Civil Code (BGB) if Coodriver has be-gun with the performance of the contract, after You expressly agreed that Coodriver could begin with the performance of the contract prior to the end of the period for withdrawal and You have confirmed that You know that with the commencement of the performance of the contract You will lose your right of withdrawal. The performance of the contract begins with the first transfer of data or, as the case may be, unlocking of the functions of an In-App Purchase by Coodriver.
