If you watch a video clip or listen to an audio clip on D100 App, d100.net or d100.hk, a cookie may remember which media player and type of clip you prefer to use on your computer. You can change your video and audio preferences at any time, or choose a player each time you view of listen to a clip. 
A cookie will tell us which pages you visit and the amount of time between each page visit. The cookie does not remember any information about you or your computer; it just helps us at Global Chinese Network Limited monitor Site usage and traffic; for example, it allows us to measure the number of repeat visitors to D100 App, d100.net or d100.hk in a given month. This data is only used in the aggregate.
Additionally, cookies may be used on pay sites to (1) identify the terms of any special offers you may have obtained, such as price discount or free trial period AND/OR (2) automatically sign you in so that you do not have to enter a username and password each time you visit."</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_matter_twentyfour_bold">D100 App, D100.net and d100.hk uses cookies at the following times:</string>

You can generally prevent cookies from being used by changing the settings in your web browser, but please be aware that by doing so you may be unable to fully utilize the Site."</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_matter_twentyseven">"Access to personally identifiable information that is collected from our D100 App and Site may be accessible for a limited period of time from the point of collection, such as where a user provides an e-mail address in order to receive an e-mail newsletter or a reminder about an upcoming program or event. In other cases, personally identifiable information may be maintained, edited and deleted at the user’s discretion at any time after the information has been submitted to Global Chinese Network Limited.

In accordance with the Ordinance, we have the right to charge a reasonable fee for the processing of any Personal Data access request."</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_matter_twentysix_bold">IV. HOW CAN I ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION?</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_matter_twentythree">"Except as expressly set forth in our policies, we will not willfully disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party without first receiving your permission. We will never sell, rent, or swap your personally identifiable information with non-affiliated third parties for their own purposes.
In terms of our own use of information, we may use your personally identifiable information for the activities described in the previous sections, and for internal purposes and marketing, promotional and fundraising purposes in support of D100 Mobile App, d100.net and d100.hk. 
We will typically explain the extent of use at the time you are asked to provide personal information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply “opt out.” Under certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal information is needed, as in contests.
In certain cases, we contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf. These service providers may maintain customer databases which may hold D100 App users or Site users’ e-mail addresses, including:
viewers, listeners and members;
D100 App or Site visitors who have provided them to Global Chinese Network Limited by registering at our D100 App or Site or signing up for a newsletter or listserv;
audience members who e-mail questions about membership or programs;
donors who submit online contributions; or
online buyers who make a purchase.
We (which includes our service providers) will use these addresses to respond to the general purposes for which we collected the information, to provide services and to operate the Site, including to respond to inquiries, to process credit card payments and billing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analysis, promotions management, to send information about D100 App, d100.net and d100.hk programs, Site, services, membership or to correspond about a purchase or product offers. For example, d100.net shop uses a third party fulfillment agent to manage orders, credit card processing, order fulfillment and shipping, and related tasks. 
Our service providers have access to your personally identifiable information as necessary to provide certain services on our behalf. They are required to maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control and can only use the information on our behalf for the purpose that we have contracted them, for example processing your order or sending you a series newsletter. They are not authorized to use your information for any other purpose. 
Similarly, personally identifiable information provided in connection with a donation intended for a program, or for purposes of ordering products, subscriptions or other services offered by the Global Chinese Network Limited and its partners, will be shared by Global Chinese Network Limited with third parties who perform services to process the donation or the applicable order. 
At times, we make customer mailing lists available to carefully screened companies whose products or services might interest individuals who have shopped on the D100 App or the Site. Please contact us at email info@d100.net if you do not prefer to share your information in this way.
We, or our service providers, may release personal identification information if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or such release is necessary to protect anyone’s rights, property or safety.
On certain pages, we offer visitors the opportunity to provide comments or other user-generated content on blogs and articles. Any information that you disclose when posting a message to these areas, along with the screen name or ID used, becomes public. In addition, the information that you disclose in these areas may be used by us for promotional and marketing purposes. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose in these public areas. 
We reserve the right to send you e-mail relating to your account status. This includes order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices of credit card problems, other transactional e-mails and notifications about major changes to our Dl00 App or Site. If you have registered for online discussions or other services, you may receive e-mail specific to your participation in those activities.
We offer several e-mail newsletters and listservs. If you no longer wish to receive a specific newsletter, you may opt out by following the unsubscribe instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter.
We use non-personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses or demographic information (zip codes and postal codes for example) to tailor our D100 App or Site to the interests/locations of our users and to measure traffic within our D100 App or Site.
Global Chinese Network Limited uses the content from the cookies to deliver relevant local resources, remember browser preferences, and improve our visitors’ experiences on the D100 App and the Site. Global Chinese Network Limited does not sell information collected by cookies nor use the information for commerce-related purposes. In addition, Global Chinese Network Limited will not filter content based on your preferences without permission. "</string>

D100全球華人廣播平台，由一群信奉以言論自由捍衛香港核心價值的有心人組成，抱着「捨我其誰」的心志，堅持講真話、行公義、好憐憫的信念，在此關鍵時刻，全力維護言論自由的天與地。

我們深信，兼聽則明。我們的平台和空間，是不同觀點與角度的格鬥現場。只要有理有據，人人皆可百無禁忌，暢所欲言，公開講，大聲講。

D100以創造民間最敢言、最自由、最開放的公共廣播機構為目標，致力為全球華人世界建構一個關心中國、遵行公義的平台，並以「全民為本、公民擁有」模式運作。"</string>
