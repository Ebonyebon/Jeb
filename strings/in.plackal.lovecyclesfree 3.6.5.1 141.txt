    <string name="tip_action_dlay1_set1">Maya says: Be thorough in recording all data. Make sure you record both start and end dates of your period. You can log a range of notes, including symptoms and moods in the notes section. Jot down any notes you think might be useful in the future.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_dlay2_set1">Maya says: If the arrival of your periods are highly unpredictable, it might be advisable to consult a physician. Before you dash to the doctor, apply the three-cycle rule. Get a check-up if changes last for three cycles in a row or if your period is delayed by more than 10 days.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_dlay3_set1">Maya says: Restoring emotional and physical balance in your life can help. Many women miss their periods occasionally. Unless you are pregnant, chances are your cycle will return to normal soon.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_dlay4_set1">Maya says: Your doctor can properly diagnose the reason for your late or missed period. Keep a record of all cycle related information in Maya. Make it a habit to log notes everyday. Presenting this data to doctors will help them make an accurate diagnosis.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_dlay5_set1">Maya says: If your cycle is delayed for more than 10 days, consult a doctor. On start of a new cycle, enter the date into Maya so that predictions will resume.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_fert1_set1">Maya says: If you have a mild case of the blues, chase it away with a comedy or funny book. Laughter is not just the best medicine, it’s the easiest and simplest form of exercise and has the health benefits of a mild workout. A few minutes of laughter will relieve tension and leave your muscles relaxed for almost 45 minutes.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_fert2_set1">Maya says: Unless you’re trying for a baby, be extra careful as you’re highly susceptible to pregnancy. In fact, you’re most fertile one to two days before ovulation, so be sure you have everything covered.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_fert3_set1">Maya says: You’ll probably notice your temperature spiking on other days, but unless it stays that way for at least three days in a row you’re probably not ovulating. Remember that if you are ill, or forget to take your temperature immediately on waking, any pattern you find may be inaccurate.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow10_set1">Maya says: Worry not, as the percentage of men who can actually decipher this is very small! Clear your calendar of big social events and make a date with yourself. A hot Epsom salt bath soak is a great place to start, as it can have amazing health benefits like improved circulation and stress relief.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow11_set1">Maya says: As a girl gets older and her periods settle down - or she gets used to her own unique cycle - she will probably find that she can predict when her period will come. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to keep track of your menstrual cycle with the calendar in Maya.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow1_set1">Maya says: Place a hot water bottle or heating pads on your lower belly and lower back. You could also soak in a warm bath to alleviate the discomfort.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow2_set1">Maya says: Kick back with a cup of chamomile or jasmine tea. An amino acid in chamomile helps reduce muscle contractions in the uterus, lessen bloating and fight insomnia. Jasmine flowers are famous for their soothing and relaxing effect on the stomach and the mind.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow3_set1">Maya says: Change sanitary pads or tampons regularly, at least every four hours. And remember to record the date when your period stops on Maya. This will make predictions more accurate.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow4_set1">Maya says: Get moving. The more physically active you are, the less likely you are to suffer from chronic aches and pains, including menstrual cramps. Cardio is good for increasing blood flow throughout your body and this in turn reduces discomfort or pain.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow5_set1">Maya says: During your period, washing more than once a day may be helpful. Keeping the whole genital region clean is essential to keep infections away. Wash the area at least once a day during your normal bathing routines.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow6_set1">Maya says: Fiber can keep gastric problems under control. Aim for 30 grams a day from cereal, fruit and vegetables. Remember to hydrate yourself with plenty of water.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow7_set1">Maya says: Indulge yourself with a massage, meditate, or learn a new hobby. Strenuous exercise will feel increasingly good during this time, so get out and enjoy physical activities that you love.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow8_set1">Maya says: Talk with your doctor if you suspect menorrhagia. Since flow volumes vary for each individual, it is difficult to self diagnose. Log notes related to flow to provide your doctor with accurate inputs.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_flow9_set1">Maya says: Talk to a friend about the issue, and take them along to the doctor’s. The solution might be a simple one, but it can stop the situation from developing into a serious underlying health issue.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_pause1_set1">Maya says: Keeping a daily record is incredibly beneficial. You will see that Maya learns about your monthly cycle over time and predicts dates more accurately. Soon you’ll have all the information you or your doctor need at your fingertips.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo10_set1">Maya says: Crash diets are a no-no. Good nutrition means eating a wide variety of foods in moderation every day, to get all the nutrients your body needs.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo11_set1">Maya says: Create a playlist with your favorite music, and go for a run in the park. It will leave you feeling high and frisky. Log personal notes about your body and mind on Maya.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo12_set1">Maya says: Get your iron from red meat, chicken, fish, fortified cereals, legumes and nuts and green leafy vegetables. Absorption can be impaired by very high-fibre diets, alcohol, the tannic acid in tea and concentrated courses of calcium (like calcium supplements).</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo13_set1">Maya says: Whatever your preferred method, there are a lot of options out there. There are so many products that it may take some experimenting before you find the one that works best for you.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo14_set1">Maya says: Choosing more red or pink clothes from your wardrobe? You’re doing it subconsciously when you’re most fertile. At least you’re not a chimp whose face turns red!</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo15_set1">Maya says: We know we’re awesome, but better yet, science says so too. Take pride in your body, learn about how it works and take care of it.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo16_set1">Maya says: Protect yourself in cold weather; wear several light layers of warm clothes, rather than one bulky layer, wrap a scarf around your neck, stay away from the wind and keep as active as possible. Eating small (hot) meals regularly helps keep energy levels up in winter.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo17_set1">Maya says: There are examples aplenty of the taboos, but you can break the silence and turn the taboo into a conversation. Knowledge is power, and you can live a better life if you know your body and feel confident about it.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo18_set1">Maya says: Are you hitting the mall to cheer up with some retail therapy? Tracking your impulses on Maya can shed light on this behavior and help you keep an eye on your spending patterns.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo19_set1">Maya says: This is one love affair that’s too good to walk away from! Pop some raw chocolate, it’s one of the best sources of magnesium, something we crave during PMS.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo1_set1">Maya says: Estrogen is like a fertilizer for the brain cells. It leads to a roughly 25% growth of synaptic connections in your hippocampus. That’s the bit that controls functions like short-term memory and decision-making - so take advantage of this boost at your work and studies.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo20_set1">Maya says: Make sure to change your tampon every four hours as longer durations increase the chance of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). TSS is a potentially fatal disease caused by bacterial infection from tampons or other intra-uterine devices (IUDs) being left in the vagina for too long.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo21_set1" formatted="false">Maya says: Young women have plenty of healthy eggs. In fact, about 90% of the eggs of a 21-year old woman are viable. Only about 10% of the eggs of a 41-year old woman might be viable. Freezing of healthy eggs is a considered a suitable option if you choose to go the mommy route at a later stage.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo22_set1">Maya says: Sounds like this guy slept through a med lecture or two himself. Don’t use this as an excuse to not study!</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo2_set1">"Maya says: With you looking and feeling your best, the timing couldn't be better for you to go out there and make your mark. Don't hold back - it's your time to shine, darling."</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo3_set1">Maya says: You’re in a happy, confident mood and you’ll feel more romantic and sociable right now. Make use of those social superpowers by speaking up in meetings, joining a new social group and scheduling time with friends!</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo4_set1">Maya says: Strenuous exercise will feel increasingly good during this time, so get out and enjoy physical activities that you love.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo5_set1">Maya says: If there’s ever a best time to treat yourself to a fancy fitness class or enroll in a swanky gym, now’s the time. When you start a fitness regimen, make sure you have professional guidance. Following the right techniques and using the right equipment will not only have the best effects, it will also prevent injuries.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo6_set1">Maya says: This is a good time to make lifestyle changes. Start eating healthier and make time for exercise. Your hormones will thank you for it. Don’t forget to keep track of your weight on Maya.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo7_set1">Maya says: Your average day is a buzzing phone and over scheduled frenzy but it’s not impossible to seize the day, even if only in bite-size chunks. Live each day to the fullest by making sure to leave time to be a little silly and have fun. Even jumping on your bike for an afternoon ride with friends will make you feel more carefree.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo8_set1">Maya says: Whether it’s choosing a certain brand of tampon because a part of the proceeds goes to help a girl or create awareness, or going online to join a support group, do your bit to help other women around the world.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_safo9_set1">Maya says: If the color, smell, or consistency of your discharge fluid seems significantly unusual, especially if it is accompanied by vaginal itching or burning, you could be noticing an infection or other condition. See your doctor right away.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft1_set1">Maya says: Practice good self-care during the week before your period and you’ll likely notice less PMS. Try some stretching and meditation to help balance body, mind and spirit, and maintain your mood and perspective.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft2_set1">Maya says: A consistent diet that includes complex carbohydrates (think bananas, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, lentils, beans etc) will provide a steady flow of energy to your brain and counter the ups and downs of blood sugar variations.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft3_set1">Maya says: Hmm… maybe the menstrual cycle isn’t just a “woman’s issue” after all. Keep the lines of communication open; it builds trust and ease with your partner.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft4_set1">Maya says: Go for generally lighter exercises like a brisk walk which will get your heart rate up. And if you have the energy? An indoor cycling session can help you break a serious sweat. (If you get tired, you can always default to a time-tested excuse — PMS! — and plop down in the saddle.)</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft5_set1">Maya says: Use a glycolic or salicylic acid based cleanser or scrub to keep your pores super clean during the two weeks before your period. If you get a pimple, dilute two or three drops of tea tree oil with water and put it on the surface of your pimple. Tea tree oil is famous for its antibacterial and soothing properties.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft6_set1">Maya says: Exercise more, it helps to promote deep-sleep stages. Avoid alcohol as progesterone is highest during the luteal phase and can exacerbate the effects of alcohol. Keep a record on Maya of the days of the month you have trouble falling asleep, as well as when you wake early or have daytime sleepiness and fatigue.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft7_set1">Maya says: Use Maya to track your moods and symptoms month after month and it can alert you to behaviour patterns in your cycle.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft8_set1">Maya says: Your period might arrive any time soon. Be prepared and throw some pads or tampons in your bag. Set reminders to different phases of the cycle in Maya.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_saft9_set1">Maya says: Start a new habit of planning for the week ahead and scheduling time with family and friends. You can plan for quiet catch-ups or fun activities based on your knowledge of your physical and emotional state. Planning ahead gives you a sense of purpose and helps set goals. It’s only a short step from there to meeting those goals and enjoying a sense of accomplishment.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_strf1_set1">Maya says: One glance at Maya’s colour coded calendar can tell you the days of menstruation and fertility. It automatically estimates your fertile window and marks those days in green. The estimated start date of the next cycle and flow dates are marked in pink.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_strt1_set1">Maya says: Record how you feel on the days before your period starts. You will then learn from your body’s hints that your period is about to arrive.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsafo1_set1">Maya says: Ovulation is the only phase (phase 3) in which a woman can get pregnant during her menstrual cycle. Sperm can live for up to five days, so intercourse in the short time leading up to ovulation can also result in conception. If you are trying to conceive, keep your doctor informed, and take care that you are not on medication that can interfere with pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsafo2_set1">Maya says: You’ll feel more easily aroused, interested in sex and just plain sexy, so enjoy it… responsibly!</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsafo3_set1">Maya says: Maya uses the simplest way to work out your most fertile time using the length of your menstrual cycle. If the dates are filled in accurately, it can be a great indicator of signs of hormonal and physical changes in your body.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsafo4_set1">Maya says: Your libido is extra high and you’re more adventurous, playful and impulsive as your hormone levels max out. After your period you may notice an increase in cervical mucus which becomes wetter and more slippery after a few days. Mucus that resembles egg white is the most fertile of all cervical mucus types. This stretchy mucus allows sperm to swim easily into the cervix.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsafo5_set1">Maya says: You’re overall happy and confident during this time, so use it to your advantage to pursue financial, career and personal goals.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsaft1_set1">Maya says: Clueing in to your own pattern is just good practice, so you have a sense of what is happening in your body and can watch out for any changes.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsaft2_set1">Maya says: Dipping hormone levels may leave you feeling mildly stressed and moody. Dress up and trick your brain into being happy and self-confident. Looking good can be directly proportional to feeling good!</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsaft3_set1">Maya says: Your menstrual cycle might mess with your head and body in multiple ways, but have no fear! You have tools like digital organizers and to-do lists (and Maya!) at your command to help you tide over forgetfulness and lethargy.</string>
    <string name="tip_action_unsaft4_set1">Maya says: Don’t worry, just hang in there for a day or two till estrogen levels are up again. Make note of your emotions and physical state in Maya – next time you’ll be better prepared.</string>
    <string name="tip_info_text1">The tips are based on information drawn from medical journals. It is closely mapped to different stages of the cycle.</string>
    <string name="tip_info_text2">Information provided in Maya is only for reference and not to be treated as medical advice.</string>
    <string name="tip_info_text3">Have a query or suggestion?</string>
    <string name="tip_long_dlay1_set1">The predictions tend be less accurate if you have just started using the app. As the amount of data logged into the app increases, the accuracy of these predictions increase. You can expect better accuracy after about four months of historical data has been entered into the app. If you are the forgetful kind, enable reminders in Maya so that you can take timely action.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_dlay2_set1">In general, periods tend to be irregular right after attaining puberty or when menopause starts. Women typically start their periods anywhere from age 10 to 15. Periods are irregular in the early years of puberty because it may take several years for the hormones that control menstruation to reach a balance. This can cause late or even missed periods. Menopause generally begins between ages 45 to 55. As the body goes through the transition, regular cycles can become irregular.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_dlay3_set1">A delayed or missed period could even be related to a simple change in your routine. Did you start a new job? Did you change your wakeup time or go on a vacation? It can take your body a little more time to adjust to a change in your routine and that can impact your cycle. Especially so if the change started at the time you would normally ovulate, causing a delay or even a skipped cycle.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_dlay4_set1">A period that arrives a few days off schedule is nothing to worry about. It mostly indicates that there has been some hormonal fluctuation during the course of the cycle. Professional athletes who train hard occasionally miss their periods. A skipped cycle is nature’s way of preventing pregnancy when the body is under stress. If you are trying to conceive, a delayed period might also indicate pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_dlay5_set1">Potential reasons a period may be delayed could be: dietary change, major weight loss or weight gain, exercise, stress caused by an event or lifestyl, a thyroid irregularity, polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic illness, birth control, premature menopause or pregnancy. Reviewing data logged into Maya will help you assess and narrow the probable causes.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_fert1_set1">The main purpose of progesterone at this point in your cycle is to help make your uterus a nice, comfortable place for an egg to implant. The combination of increased estrogen and progesterone levels often leads to breast tenderness.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_fert2_set1">Some women may recognize the signs that they’re ovulating, such as a change in vaginal secretions (it becomes thinner and more stretchy), and a change in body temperature. Other signs could include breast tenderness, bloating, mild abdominal pain and increased sex drive.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_fert3_set1">BBT is your temperature when you first wake up in the morning or after at least three hours of uninterrupted sleep. To record your BBT, you need to use a basal thermometer. This has a finer scale than a normal thermometer and lets you record tiny changes in your body temperature. Take your temperature BEFORE you get out of bed and chart it on Maya. When you ovulate, hormonal changes trigger a slight rise in your BBT, which lasts at least until your next period. You are most fertile on the day of the temperature spike and on the few days before. So, the first month or two of charting your temperature will only tell you when you’ve already ovulated. But soon you’ll be able to see whether there is a pattern. If there is a pattern you’ll be able to predict your most fertile days the next time around. If you do become pregnant, your temperature will stay elevated throughout your pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow10_set1">The hormonal cycles related to your menstrual cycles also alter the sound of your voice. Cells from the larynx and vagina have similar hormone receptors. Apparently men can detect from your voice if you are menstruating. Men are not only good listeners when it comes to distinguishing the “period voice”, but they also have a keen sense of smell - at least when it comes to a woman’s menstrual cycle. It’s not surprising, since it’s proven that a man’s testosterone levels are influenced by a woman’s scent, especially when she is ovulating.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow11_set1">Menarche is a girl’s first menstrual period. The first few periods are usually light and irregular. Usually, after a year or two, the menstrual cycle will become more regular. Some women continue to have irregular periods into adulthood though. The onset of menopause is another phase in most women’s lives when period flow and length become erratic. By definition menopause is the absence of menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow1_set1">Your uterus is a muscle, and it squeezes really hard, causing pain. Heat is an old-fashioned but useful remedy for relaxing crampy muscles. It short-circuits the production of pain-causing chemicals called prostaglandins that are involved in muscle contractions. Heat dissipates pain by opening the vessels and improving blood flow.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow2_set1">The abdominal pain, back aches, and nausea during a woman’s period can actually affect how she thinks and feels, reducing her cognitive ability. Menstrual cramps can interfere with tasks that need a lot of focussed concentration, or even with your multi-tasking capabilities.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow3_set1">Your flow can change throughout your menstrual cycle where some days are lighter or heavier than others. Flow is generally heavier during the beginning of your period and gradually gets lighter. Menstrual fluid contains blood, cells from the lining of the uterus and mucus. Though the average length of a period is between three days and one week, it’s not uncommon for it to be longer or shorter. Maya accommodates up to 12 days of flow duration. Some women have longer periods that overlap with the beginning of ovulation - even though they’re still menstruating. So there’s a small chance of pregnancy even during this phase.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow4_set1">More estrogen stimulates the release of feel-good chemicals like endorphins, which reduce cramps and wipe out any remnants of the crankiness or fogginess you may have experienced during premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Walking, running, the elliptical trainer, and other forms of cardiovascular exercise will help raise endorphin levels and get you out of the period funk.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow5_set1">Perfumed products can disrupt your vagina’s healthy, natural balance of bacteria and pH levels and cause irritation. Gently wash from front to back, using unscented, mild soap or cleanser on the external genital area. Using a douche inside the vagina is not recommended as it can disrupt the normal vaginal bacteria.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow6_set1">The hormones in our bodies are especially sensitive to diet and nutrition. If you’re experiencing tummy troubles, eat lots of fresh vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and fruit. Avoid red meat, milk and fatty foods. Foods like refined sugar are inflammatory so you should avoid it throughout the month, not just at the time of your period. Zinc has been found to relieve period pain because of its effectiveness in removing prostaglandins. Another great herbal remedy is turmeric. Keep in mind that any supplement or medication to deal with your period-related symptoms should be taken in consultation with your doctor.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow7_set1">The good news doesn’t end there – oxytocin provides several health benefits. It helps to regulate sleep patterns, calms you and contributes to a general sense of well being. Additionally, you’ll feel a boost of energy and a huge improvement in your mood and brain function. You may even feel more assertive and extroverted. This is a time when you may experience a wide variety of feelings related to self-sufficiency. Yay!</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow8_set1">How do you know if you have heavy bleeding? If you need to change your tampon or pad after less than two hours, or you pass large clots, that is heavy bleeding. Untreated menorrhagia can stop you from living your life to the fullest. It can also cause anemia and leave you feeling tired or weak.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_flow9_set1">Menorrhagia is diagnosed when both you and your doctor agree your menstrual bleeding is heavy, after details about your periods and medical history have been taken. Don’t shy away from the problem. Many women do not get help because they are embarrassed to talk with a doctor about their symptoms. Talking openly with your doctor is very important in making sure you are diagnosed properly and get the right treatment.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_pause1_set1">Keeping track of your cycle every day has never been easier! Maya helps you manage your cycles and understand the changes your body goes through. It also helps in increasing accuracy of contraception and conception and empowers you by giving you control. Not only can you store important information and record personal notes on Maya, it is also a wonderful tool to analyze your physical and mental state and see the effects that hormones have on your body and mind.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo10_set1">Women’s nutritional needs change during the different phases of their reproductive life cycle. As a woman you need fewer calories but more nutrients than men to be at your best. Deficiencies can occur if your diet is inadequate over a long period of time. And not just that, the interplay of those hormones throughout your cycle can play mischief with your body and mind. Your energy intakes are generally higher in the menstrual and premenstrual phases.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo11_set1">Some weight gain can happen during this time. Not a lot – one quarter to one-half pound, so no cause for worry there! But this phase of the cycle is mostly emotionally stable and physically symptom-free. As the brain starts to tell the ovary to get ready to ovulate, estrogen slowly rises and a feeling of well-being and calm prevail.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo12_set1">Women and men metabolize iron from food at roughly the same rate, but while men need about 8 mg of iron in their daily diet, women need up to 18 mg (or 27 mg if pregnant). Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in women, and it can lead to anemia, which in turn can leave you feeling tired and breathless.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo13_set1">Your days of fretting about a stain on your skirt are over. Once you begin menstruating, you’ll need to use something to absorb the blood. Most women use a pad or tampon. But some use menstrual cups, which can be inserted into the vagina to catch and hold the blood (instead of absorbing it, like a tampon). Many women switch back and forth: sometimes they use tampons and sometimes they use pads, depending on the situation, whether it’s night or day, where they’re going to be, and their menstrual flow.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo14_set1">During the late follicular phase (phase 2) of their menstrual cycle women experience subtle changes in their mating psychology, behavior and physiology - very similar to the changes we see in other primates. Research has shown that as ovulation approaches, women’s voices rise in pitch, their body odor becomes more sexually attractive, and their clothing reveals more skin. Men find all these changes appealing. So not a far cry from male chimps!</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo15_set1">Humans are among a select few animals that release their uterine lining in a visible menstrual period. This is probably because humans have a distinctively thick uterine lining. If an egg meets a sperm and fertilization occurs, the developing pregnancy sets down “deep roots” in the uterine lining. This built up blood and tissue lining supports the pregnancy’s attachment and development while also protecting the mother. If fertilization does not happen, the amount of lining is too substantial to be completely resorbed (resorption is common in many other animal species who build up their uterine lining), and so we shed it through our period.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo16_set1">Changes in temperature affects menstrual cycles by changing your body’s metabolic rate, which leads to hormonal imbalance. If you’ve moved to a place where the climate is warmer or colder, the body takes some time to adapt to the new environment. Women who are used to cold will burn fat faster in a hot climate. A sudden change in temperature may change a woman’s menstrual cycle.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo17_set1">Menstruation is still considered taboo in some places. While pre-teen girls in America may have to endure teasing from their less-than-understanding male classmates, in places like rural India, girls are told not to cook food lest it be polluted. In Italy, women aren’t supposed to make pasta sauce during their periods. Until very recently, people in the UK believed that dough wouldn’t rise if a woman tried to make bread while menstruating!</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo18_set1">Blame your ovaries. Almost two-thirds of the women who were surveyed about their spending habits in correlation with their menstrual cycles admitted they had bought something on an impulse in the later stages of their menstrual cycle. The academic explanation? Retail therapy. Women go shopping to help deal with their PMS, without being aware of how hormonal fluctuations affect their choices as consumers.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo19_set1">Long thought to be an aphrodisiac, chocolate has been inextricably linked to Cupid and lovers since it was discovered by the ancient Aztecs and carried to the old World. The New World likes it too! Women make 75% of chocolate purchases. How sinful is it? There is mounting evidence of the health benefits of eating dark chocolate in moderation. It may help prevent heart disease and cancer, reduce blood pressure and depression and improve your mood by boosting serotonin.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo1_set1">So, you survived your period. The next phase is marked by Maya as the one with the least chance of pregnancy. For those with a shorter cycle length, there is still a chance of pregnancy. This is because a sperm can stay alive up to seven days in the cervical fluid, but its ability to fertilize an egg comes down dramatically after three days. For most practical purposes, the lifespan of a sperm in the vagina is considered to be five days. What’s happening in your body now? Your estrogen levels in particular will skyrocket between now and just before you start ovulating in order to prepare your uterus for fertilization. You can use Maya to become more familiar with the signs of ovulation and the pattern of your menstrual cycle. You can then use this information to avoid or encourage pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo20_set1">Dr. Earle Haas invented the modern tampon in 1929, which was called a “catamenial device” or “monthly device.” He trademarked the brand name Tampax. Tampon is French for “plug”. Before the creation of tampons in the 1920, Western women used reusable rags. Some scholars suggest that pre-modern women just bled into their clothes, especially since they had fewer menstrual cycles than modern women.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo21_set1">Unlike other cells in the body, egg cells take years to “grow up.” That is, they spend years inside the ovaries in an immature state, maturing just before they are released during ovulation. Among the hundreds of eggs in this half-mature state, what causes one egg and not the others to be released? No one knows!</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo22_set1">A Harvard professor warned girls that their periods could be disrupted by college education. In the 20th century, female college students were warned that their menstrual blood would be diverted to the brain. In the early 20th century, Dr Edward H Clarke of Harvard Medical School wrote a book called Sex in Education. In it he suggested that “higher education would cause a woman’s uterus to atrophy.” In other words, he was asserting that if a young woman attended college, all the blood in her body would be diverted from her uterus to stimulate her brains.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo2_set1">At the same time testosterone production ramps up too, increasing your sex drive. Combined with the swell of brain activity from estrogen, that means you’re at your most social, flirtatious, mentally sharp and energetic best. Testosterone also boosts your sense of competition. Use this to your advantage! Brainstorming and problem solving are a breeze during this phase, so initiate new projects and make big decisions.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo3_set1">Right about now, it’s that time in the follicular phase (phase 2) when your follicles are maturing. Estradiol is the queen hormone during this phase, responsible for reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol. It’s interesting to know that during this phase you have the same amount of progesterone in your body as a man. The corpus luteum produces progesterone to stimulate the uterus in preparation for pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo4_set1">It’s amazing how estrogen can change our behavior. In a famous dirty t-shirt experiment, women were more attracted to men’s sweat on their dirty t-shirts during the week before ovulation. Estrogen gives womens an advantage over men in fighting off infections and enjoying stronger immune systems. Go estrogen!</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo5_set1">Women gain more strength and muscle from strength-training during the first half of their cycle than the second half, so this is your time to shine. Unlike the week of your period when you’re tired and less likely to exercise at your peak, you’ll really benefit from hardcore workout routines like indoor cycling, high intensity interval training, rowing, crossfit, cardio kickboxing. Anything is fair game. As always, it’s a good idea to speak to your doctor before you start a new fitness program.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo6_set1">It’s not just the estrogen, but the balance between the two hormones, as well as other factors like lifestyle, diet, stress, habits, other medical conditions and culture that affect us and make us who we are during our fertile and menstruating years.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo7_set1">What’s happening inside you? Your FSH (follicle-stimulating hormones) levels vary throughout your monthly cycle, but spike immediately before ovulation. FSH helps to control and regulate your menstrual cycle, and plays a role in the production of the ova, or eggs, in the ovary.Many women, especially those who have experienced PMS, feel much better during the early part of the follicular phase (phase 2) as their hormone levels have dropped back to baseline.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo8_set1">Why should a natural and healthy process be hidden in the dark? The shame and stigma associated with menstruation means that questions go unasked, and issues remain unaddressed. Lack of awareness about menstrual hygiene causes reproductive and health problems, and girls having their periods are forced to stay away from school.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_safo9_set1">Fluid made by glands inside the vagina and cervix carries away dead cells and bacteria. This keeps the vagina clean and helps prevent infection. Most of the time, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal. The amount can vary, as can odor and color (from clear to a milky white-ish), depending on the phase of your menstrual cycle. There may be more discharge if you are ovulating, breastfeeding, or are sexually aroused. The smell may be different if you are pregnant or you haven’t been diligent about your personal hygiene.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft1_set1">Those falling hormone levels give way for cortisol, which further contribute to your bad vibes. A dip in mood, headaches, poor sleep, a general absence of energy and enthusiasm, bloating and breast tenderness in the luteal phase (phase 4) are all pretty common as you approach your period. This is PMS in other words. Good habits like a healthy, whole foods diet, plenty of water, exercise and good sleep help regularize this time of the month.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft2_set1">Sugar cravings, fatigue and headaches signify a different type of PMS. In addition to sugar you may also crave chocolate, white bread, white rice, pastries, and noodles. These food cravings may be because of the increased responsiveness to insulin related to a rise in hormone levels before menstruation. Here, you may experience symptoms of low blood sugar; your brain is signaling a need for fuel.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft3_set1">How do you talk to your male partner about menstruation? First, shed the embarrassment. Some day your body might grow a human; how amazing is that? Relish your womanhood for what it is. This starts with learning to talk about your period with your partner. Maintain a healthy attitude and answer questions about what is a natural occurrence.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft4_set1">It can also boost your body temperature up to 1 degree, which isn’t enough to affect your performance, but could help you break a sweat more quickly. Although you might feel particularly unsettled, the best thing you can do is push through it — all the way to the gym: Because exercise gives you a natural endorphin high, it can elevate your mood and actually make you feel better. Another bonus: PMS might make you feel bloaty and sweating can help you get rid of extra fluids.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft5_set1">As your hormone levels shift from the more female oriented estrogen and progesterone to the more male oriented testosterone, your oil glands go into overdrive; pores blow up and cystic zits emerge. All these hormonal fluctuations due to your menstrual cycle can increase production of sebum closer to your period, and makes for the perfect breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft6_set1">It can be frustrating to suddenly turn into an insomniac and toss and turn all night. What’s going on? Rising and falling levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle can affect your ability to fall and stay asleep – as well as influence the quality of your sleep.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft7_set1">It’s interesting to know that women consume more calories during the luteal phase (4) because evolution has designed psychological and physiological mechanisms that favored non-mating activities like food foraging during the non-fertile phase of women’s cycles. These consumption behaviors happen without conscious awareness, making you vulnerable to cyclical temptations for high calorie foods and appearance-enhancing products.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft8_set1">The human female egg is a giant compared to other cells in the body. It’s the largest cell in the human body, and the only human cell that can be seen with the naked eye. That said, the days before your period mimic pregnancy. The body is actually preparing for pregnancy during this time, so the hormones it secretes, namely progesterone, cause similar symptoms such as fluid retention, tender breasts, a bloated feeling, and acne.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_saft9_set1">Thank heavens for modern technology. The days of using pen and paper to keep track of menstrual cycles are behind us. On the Maya app you can not only track your period dates, you can also make records of body temperature, moods, symptoms, weight and a host of other signs to help you understand your menstrual cycle better. Each of the four unique phases of your monthly cycle brings about different physical and emotional strengths in you. Maya helps you see your cycles in a new light, so you’re working with your cycle instead of against it.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_strf1_set1">The menstruation phase (phase 1) is triggered when the unfertilized egg encourages the uterine lining to shed along with a bit of blood. The phase that follows right after your period ends is called the follicular phase (phase 2). It’s the time when your body is preparing an egg for pregnancy. The ovulatory phase (phase 3) begins as an egg is released from your ovary into the fallopian tubes, where it will disintegrate if not fertilized within about 12-24 hours. During the luteal phase (phase 4) the lining of the uterus thickens in anticipation of a fertilized egg. If the egg is not fertilized the uterus gets ready to release its unfertilized egg along with any extra blood or tissue that accumulated during the follicular phase (phase 2).</string>
    <string name="tip_long_strt1_set1">It’s a good idea to get to know your cycle. Each month, make a record of the date that you start to menstruate on Maya. Knowing the first day of your cycle is helpful in determining when your next period will arrive and calculating which days are most favorable either to try and conceive or to avoid pregnancy. Soon you’ll begin to see a regular pattern on your calendar.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsafo1_set1">Around the time women start ovulating they view men’s faces differently. Reward regions of the brain light up. At the same time, the frontal cortex, which manages self-control, may power down. As a result of all this activity in your brain you might find yourself attracted to more masculine looking faces, as you’re subconsciously seeking a virile partner. Men also find women more attractive when they’re ovulating.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsafo2_set1">The egg’s only goal is to get fertilized, so all kinds of things are happening with your mind and body around ovulation. While the egg is maturing the follicle secretes a powerful reproductive hormone, estradiol (estrogen). Estradiol helps to mature and maintain the female reproductive system. There’s evidence that women tend to spend more time making themselves look more attractive during this phase. Now you know why you’re spending all that time in front of the mirror on some days!</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsafo3_set1">These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours). If you get intimate six or more days before you ovulate, the chance you will get pregnant is virtually zero. The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation (27-33%). At the end of the fertile window, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsafo4_set1">Many marketers know that this is the time you’re most likely to spend money on clothes and makeup to feel more attractive. No one knows how men can tell, but several studies have found women report that men become more attentive and jealous around fertile days. Is it possible that male partners see other men as a greater threat to their dominance? Not that far from the animal kingdom, are we?</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsafo5_set1">That growth peaks at the start of ovulation and may improve your memory and your ability to process information. But once you’ve begun ovulating, your estrogen and testosterone stores plummet, which may leave you feeling a little cranky. At the same time progesterone levels begins to swell, and this can be very calming. This hormone is preparing your uterus and uterine lining for implantation in case there’s fertilization of the egg.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsaft1_set1">The combination of increased estrogen and progesterone levels often leads to breast tenderness. Soon the peaceful mood that has held out this long will take a hit as the hormones plunge and PMS will make her moody way back into your life. When it comes to the complete menstrual cycle, every woman has a slightly different pattern. However, most women bleed, then are dry for a few days, then experience a light, mucus-like discharge during pre-ovulation. The discharge becomes increasingly cloudy and thick to indicate that ovulation has likely ended.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsaft2_set1">The absence of a fertilized egg cell gradually causes a woman’s body to stop releasing the hormones (progesterone) that would otherwise prepare the uterus for the developing egg cell. In response, the uterus sheds its lining. If the egg cell does become fertilized by a sperm, it will be transported by tiny hair-like cells called cilia to the uterus. There, it lodges in the uterine wall in a process called implantation and receives nourishment from the uterine lining. Even though your egg is viable only for 12-24 hours, sperm can survive and fertilize it for up to five days after intercourse.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsaft3_set1">Unfortunately, as your ovulation ends and your progesterone levels continue to rise, your hippocampus and other parts of your brain become less active. This directly translates into a dip in short-term memory, verbal fluency and general sociability. According to research, your brain’s grey matter stores also shrink.</string>
    <string name="tip_long_unsaft4_set1">The pre-PMS phase is the first time estrogen levels dip. This might leave you feeling lethargic and irritated. Hormones reacting with brain chemistry may produce very vivid dreams (hopefully not nightmares!). If you’re feeling all emotional all of a sudden, blame the spike in progesterone. Higher levels of progesterone increases the stress chemical cortisol in the body. If you’re already stressing about something, cortisol will just make it worse, so take a deep breath and calm down.</string>

    <string name="tip_short_dlay1_set1">The calculations and predictions in Maya are based on historical data. Since the cycles fluctuate based on a variety of factors, an occasional deviation from the prediction could be expected.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_dlay2_set1">Concerned about a late period? Missed or late periods happen for many reasons. Apart from pregnancy, periods can also be delayed due to factors like age, hormonal imbalance, lifestyle changes or some medical conditions.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_dlay3_set1">Most women have between 11 and 13 menstrual cycles each year. Since this differs for each individual, you may have fewer or more cycles. To decide whether you have missed a period, or if it is irregular, you must assess based on what is normal for you.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_dlay4_set1">Stay calm if your cycle is off by a couple of days. The menstrual cycle is complex and is controlled by many different glands and the hormones that these glands produce.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_dlay5_set1">Tips update based on the progress of the cycle. It is now paused as there is a delay in the start of the next cycle. When a new cycle is entered into the app, the tips will update again.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_fert1_set1">When the egg is mature, it is released from your ovaries (ovulation, phase 3) and travels down the fallopian tubes. Occasionally more than one egg is released. Your fertility is at its highest now and in the next couple of days.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_fert2_set1">The sudden drop in estrogen immediately after ovulation (phase 3) can make you feel irritable or emotional for a couple of days until estrogen and progesterone levels start to rise again.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_fert3_set1">Today is the last day of your fertile phase. Learn to spot your body’s fertility signs by charting your basal body temperature (BBT) and monitoring your cervical mucus. BBT is an easy, fast, inexpensive and accurate way to help you confirm ovulation.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow10_set1">Do you know that men can tell if a woman is on her period by her voice? Here are some little known facts about the mystery behind Mother Nature’s monthly gift.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow11_set1">Though the average period lasts between 3-7 days, some women’s cycles may be longer or shorter, and more or less predictable than others. Typically, menarche and menopause are times when flow lengths are erratic.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow1_set1">You’re not alone in combating killer cramps. Virtually all women in their childbearing years have period pain. But hang on before calling in sick – there’s help on the way!</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow2_set1">"Don't let cramps and moodswings get in the way! It’s time to take some simple steps to put an end to period pain and irritability."</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow3_set1">The average period releases about 4-12 teaspoons of menstrual fluid per cycle and only a small amount of that is blood. You will notice that the fluid is reddish brown, a slightly darker colour than venous blood.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow4_set1">You’ll start to produce more estrogen and testosterone as your period progresses, although levels of both will still be quite low. The good news is that you will begin to feel more active and energetic.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow5_set1">Good personal hygiene includes appropriate cleansing during menstruation. It’s a good idea to avoid perfumed soaps, gels, scented wipes, vaginal deodorants and antiseptics.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow6_set1">Many women have gastro upsets like diarrhea, gas, or constipation during their periods. It could be that old villain Prostaglandins - the chemicals that cause cramping in your uterus, do the same in your bowels.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow7_set1">Hurrah! Aunt Flo is on her way out! She makes way for lots of oxytocin, your “cuddle hormone”. This means that you feel more attractive than usual and are more receptive to love.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow8_set1">Menorrhagia is a condition where menstrual bleeding lasts more than 7 days. It’s also the word for bleeding that is very heavy. It is one of the most common gynecologic complaints these days.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_flow9_set1">Menorrhagia, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding is more common than you think. But many women do not know that they can get help for it. Medical therapy for menorrhagia is tailored to the individual.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_pause1_set1">Tracking is currently paused. To get started, simply press and hold the start date of your latest cycle and Maya will begin tracking.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo10_set1">As a woman, you need greater amounts of certain nutrients than men, particularly iron and calcium. Your reproductive life - which can include menstruation, pregnancy, lactation and menopause - means that your nutritional needs differ greatly from men.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo11_set1">Whether or not you’re trying to get pregnant, the follicular phase(2) is all about fertilization. Your estrogen levels are on the rise as your body works to choose the perfect egg.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo12_set1">Witness the unstoppable power of Ironwoman! Let’s talk about iron in your diet. You need more iron than men to make up for about 1 mg that you lose everyday, during your period.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo13_set1">Pads, tampons, menstrual cups, period panties… when it comes to protection, there are a lot of options out there. When deciding what type of protection to use, it’s really up to you.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo14_set1">It’s not difficult to tell when a female chimpanzee is in heat. When domestic cats enter their fertile phase they become the feline equivalent of a beauty queen to the local males. Humans are obviously different. Or are we?</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo15_set1">Did you know that the only mammals to undergo menopause are elephants, humpback whales and human females? However, humans menstruate in a unique way from other species.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo16_set1">For some women, periods tend to be heavier, more painful and longer in the colder months. What can you do to make things more comfortable, other than moving to the Bahamas?</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo17_set1">Still find it difficult to talk about your period? That’s because traditionally menstruation has been seen as unclean or embarrassing, and many religions consider menstruation ritually unclean.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo18_set1">Credit card bills piling up suspiciously at the same time every month? Your period turns you into a shopaholic. You are more likely to splurge on a shopping spree 10 days before your periods begin.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo19_set1">You’re sure this relationship is wrong, even sinful. You’ve tried to break it off. But try as you may, you just can’t end it – your willpower crumbles, and you go back for more. We’re talking of your love affair with chocolate.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo1_set1">Your period is done! A lot of people assume that you can’t get pregnant while you are on your period and during the ‘safe’ phase. Depending on the overall length of your cycle, there is still a small chance of pregnancy.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo20_set1">What did we do before tampons? Ancient Egyptians used softened papyrus as rudimentary tampons. Hippocrates notes that the Greeks used lint wrapped around wood. Ouch!</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo21_set1">On average, women ovulate a mere 400 to 500 eggs in her lifetime. That makes eggs far rarer than sperms. In fact, more sperms are released during a single ejaculation than the number of eggs a woman produces in her entire lifetime.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo22_set1">Can you believe that there was a time not too long ago when some people apparently believed that earning your college degree would cause permanent damage to your reproductive organs?</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo2_set1">You will definitely be feeling more confident. Your brain is super productive, and those rising estrogen levels sharpen your verbal fluency and decision making skills.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo3_set1">Did you know that when a baby girl is born, she has all the eggs her body will ever use, and many more, perhaps as many as 450,000? They are stored in her ovaries, each inside its own sac called a follicle.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo4_set1">Even your sense of smell is affected. Peaking estrogen levels make your nose more attuned to pheromones, the chemicals our bodies release to trigger sexual desire.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo5_set1">Testosterone can help you sculpt lean muscle mass, and estrogen builds connective tissues that bind your muscle to your bones, so this phase, when your period lets up, is the ideal time for you to tone up.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo6_set1">Estrogen and progesterone do a complicated dance throughout your cycle. During the follicular phase (phase 2), as the ovary gets ready to ovulate, estrogen slowly rises and a feeling of well-being and calm prevail.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo7_set1">This is your happy time of the month. If there’s something not quite right, or if you’re in a stressful situation that’s causing you unhappiness, carve some time out to create some happy time for yourself.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo8_set1">Grab your chocolate, settle into a cozy spot, and reach out to help and support other women around the world. In many parts of the world menstruation is a taboo, and you can play a big part in changing that!</string>
    <string name="tip_short_safo9_set1">Do you notice discharge of fluids when you are not on your period? No cause for alarm. Vaginal discharge serves an important housekeeping function in the female reproductive system.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft1_set1">When your body prepares to jettison its unfertilized egg, your progesterone and estrogen levels fall off the cliff. This can be a mood-dampener (ha ha, what an understatement!).</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft2_set1">Get ready for that goblin – PMS. Before it overtakes and overwhelms you, stock up on nourishing, nurturing foods to combat sweet and salt cravings.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft3_set1">Men either joke about a woman having PMS or know nothing about the biological process. It’s time to talk about what is usually considered a “woman’s issue”. Your cycle can significantly affect your partner’s life.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft4_set1">Your body is revving up for your period with a surge in progesterone and, for some, crazy cramps, along with moodiness, tender breasts, and fluid retention that makes you feel markedly un-hot - even in your most flattering workout gear.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft5_set1">Pay special attention to your skin at this time. With chances of pesky pimples or zits making their way, put them to rest by drinking lots of water and avoiding foods that are oily or contain a lot of heat.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft6_set1">Are you finding it hard to sleep? If you’re dealing with PMS symptoms like bloating, irritability, headaches, mood swings and abdominal cramps, you may find it affecting the quality of your sleep.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft7_set1">Your appetite peaks in the luteal or infertile phase of your menstrual cycle. Watch out for cravings for high-calorie foods, and spikes in food purchases.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft8_set1">Know much about eggs? If you’re like most people, you know more about the eggs that come in a carton than the ones a woman’s body makes. That’s too bad. As cells go, human eggs are truly amazing.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_saft9_set1">Aunt Flo is visiting… again! Whether you call it Aunt Flo, the Red Tide, simply the Monthly Visit, a surprise period can be a real downer - not to mention tough on the laundry.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_strf1_set1">Your cycle is expected today. The entire duration of a menstrual cycle can be divided into four phases: menstruation phase (phase 1), follicular phase (phase 2), ovulation phase (phase 3) and luteal phase (phase 4).</string>
    <string name="tip_short_strt1_set1">The start of the menstrual cycle is defined as the first day of bleeding. The word “menstruation” comes from menses, the Latin word for “month”. So now you know why it is called the monthly visit!</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsafo1_set1">The ovulatory phase (phase 3), marked in green in Maya, begins as a surge in luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone forces the dominant egg to break free from its follicle and nest in a fallopian tube, where it will disintegrate if not fertilized within the next 12-24 hours.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsafo2_set1">It is now past the midway mark on the follicular phase (phase 2). Your ovary produces 5 to 20 follicles, each of which houses an immature egg. Only one of these eggs begin to grow and as it matures, the others die.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsafo3_set1">The fertile window is the days in your menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. Technically this is only during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsafo4_set1">You are more likely to display sexual behavior prior to ovulation than during any other phase of the menstrual cycle. Increased libido might be a sign that you are about to ovulate.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsafo5_set1">Thanks to the high amounts of estrogen you were producing for the last week, grey matter in your brain has expanded, particularly in your hippocampus.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsaft1_set1">Today marks the beginning of the Luteal phase (phase 4). Your egg cell stays in the fallopian tube for 24 hours. The main purpose of progesterone at this point in your cycle is to help make your uterus a nice, comfortable place for an egg to implant.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsaft2_set1">If the egg is not fertilized within 12-24 hours after its release from the ovary, it will stop developing and will dissolve before reaching the uterus. Also, your ovaries will stop producing estrogen and progesterone.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsaft3_set1">Guys have it easy. Their bodies are pretty much perpetually locked and loaded when it comes to their reproductive capabilities. Us womenfolk on the other hand endure a monthly ebb and flow of hormones in order to make conception possible.</string>
    <string name="tip_short_unsaft4_set1">As progesterone and estrogen levels drop, some women experience symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, which can include irritability, anger or sadness. Some women experience mild PMS, others severe and some not at all (lucky girls!)</string>
