You agree to use the App for the purposes set out in these Terms of Use in accordance with these Terms of Use and applicable law.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The App is being continuously developed and new functions and services that go beyond the scope of the free basic version of the App shall therefore be offered on a periodic basis. Additional functions and services within the App may be subject to a charge or become subject to a charge at a later date.

You may need to adjust these provisions and settings accordingly; please contact your provider for further information. Bosch has no influence on any adjustments that need to be made to these provisions or settings.
