    <string name="liability_instruct">For international travel to or from another country, airline liability is governed by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention. There are no financial limits for death or bodily injury, and the airline may make an advance payment to cover immediate passenger or domestic travel. These baggage liability limitations apply unless you declare a higher valuation and pay additional charges at check-in. In case of international travel, any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of the actual or scheduled arrival of the aircraft; and, in case of baggage claims, written notice to the carrier must be made within 7 days of the receipt of checked baggage in case of damage, and, in case of delay, within 21 days from the date on which it was placed at the disposal of the passenger. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.</string>

If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadline (which are available upon request from the air carrier), persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations.
