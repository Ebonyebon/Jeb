    <string name="Question_1">Q: Why are the hearing aids not reacting to a change I make in the App?</string>
    <string name="Answer_1_1">A1: The mobile device may be held too far away from your hearing aids. It is designed to work while being held infront of you in a central position.</string>
    <string name="Answer_1_2">"A2: The mobile device's speaker volume may be set too low. Try increasing the mobile device's speaker volume and try again. If this has no effect your mobile device may have a low sound output. For such devices, adjust the \"Broadcast level\" under the options menu."</string>
    <string name="Answer_1_3" />
    <string name="Question_2">Q: Why is there no effect when attempting to adjust volume or Sound Balance? Other functions work correctly.</string>
    <string name="Answer_2">A: Your hearing care professional may have disabled the Volume/Sound Balance option due to audiological reasons. Contact your dispenser and discuss the possibility of enabling Volume/SoundBalance in your hearing aids.</string>
    <string name="Question_3">Q: What is meant by \"Performance Level\" in the \"Advanced Settings\" option?</string>
    <string name="Answer_3">A: Performance levels dictate which features are present in which hearing aids. If you do not know what performance level you have, please consult your hearing care professional.</string>
    <string name="Question_4">Q: Why does nothing happen when I press \"Program Button\"? (Top Centre of the Home Screen)</string>
    <string name="Answer_4">A: Selecting this button provides access to your programs menu which lists your programs when more than 1 program was configured during setup. If only one program was configured then no menu will be displayed.</string>
    <string name="Question_5">Q: What is the Spatial Configurator option?</string>
    <string name="Answer_5">A: The Spatial Configurator is a feature to control the direction and span (width) of the microphones.</string>
    <string name="Question_6">Q: How does the Spatial Configurator option work?</string>
    <string name="Answer_6">"A1: By selecting either the Front, Back, Left or Right on the diagram will configure the microphones so the user will hear sounds better from the chosen direction. The \"A\" symbol will set the hearing aids back to automatic mode whereby the hearing aid microphones adapt to changes in the environment. Please note, no confirmation audio signals are heard in the hearing aids when making a selection and the selection remains highlighted for 15 minutes. 
A2: Selecting either of the 5 Span controls located at the bottom of the screen will widen or narrow the width of the microphone beam. Please note, no confirmation audio signals are heard in the hearing aids when making a selection and the selection remains highlighted for 15 minutes."</string>
    <string name="Question_7">Q: How does the Mute Button work? (Bottom Left of Screen)</string>
    <string name="Answer_7">A: The function of the mute button is to toggle the hearing aids into and out of standby mode. While in standby mode there will be no output from the hearing aids.</string>
    <string name="Question_8">Q: How Broadcast level works? (options menu)</string>
    <string name="Answer_8">A: In order to control the hearing aids the app must send a signal through the smartphone or tablets loudspeaker. Due to the large variety of loudspeaker outputs we included an option to reduce or increase the signal even further if the volume control of the smartphone or tablet is not sufficient.</string>
