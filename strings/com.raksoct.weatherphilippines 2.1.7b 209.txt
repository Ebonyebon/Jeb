    <string name="about_us">&lt;h2> Who We Are&lt;/h2> &lt;p> WeatherPhilippines provides the country with a premier weather sensing and forecasting system made possible by technology, inclusive partnerships, and engagement. Founded in 2012 by the Aboitiz Foundation and UnionBank, WeatherPhilippines delivers free, more localized, and accurate weather information accessed through its website and mobile application. Its services complement government&amp;rsquo;s nationwide efforts on disaster risk reduction, and aims to help build a #WeatherWiserNation. Supporting WeatherPhilippines&amp;rsquo; proactive direction is new technology supplier Meteologix AG, an international weather information provider based in Switzerland. Led by Joerg Kachelmann, Meteologix seeks to introduce innovative weather tools and systems.&lt;/p> &lt;h2> Our Mission &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/h2> &lt;p> To become A #WeatherWiser Nation by optimizing weather knowledge for socio-economic growth and progress.&lt;/p> &lt;h2> History&lt;/h2> &lt;p> Every year, 10-20 typhoons enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). And every year, we spend Php 9-10 billion for post-disaster recovery initiatives. This insight pushed the private sector to change our approach to disasters, from a costly and reactive method, to a more proactive, collaborative, and sustainable model. Thus, the Aboitiz Group established WeatherPhilippines Foundation in 2012. Through localized weather technology, inclusive partnerships, and meaningful engagements, WeatherPhilippines delivers free, more localized, and accurate weather information accessed through weatherph.org, and the free WeatherPhilippines mobile application.&lt;/p></string>

    <string name="faq_answer11">We provide highly localized weather information: (1) localized weather observation from our 800+ AWS; and (2) localized weather forecasts using a multi-model forecasting system</string>
    <string name="faq_answer12">Microclimates (e.g., localized thunderstorms)</string>
    <string name="faq_answer13">Thunderstorms are weather systems that affect the accuracy of forecasts due to their rapid formation and dissipation over certain areas. With a lifespan of approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours, thunderstorms are not usually captured by weather models during the latter’s 6-hour updating period. To view our Lightning Analysis map, visit https://weatherph.org/weather-maps/ and click the button for lightning detection.</string>
    <string name="faq_answer14">Many people have a misconception that weather forecasting is learned and mastered perfectly. However, this is not the case due to the fact that Weather Forecasting can never be a perfect science because of the fluid and chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Weather is CONSTANTLY changing and there is a high degree of uncertainty in all weather data. Weather prediction will always be 95 percent science and 5 percent art.</string>
    <string name="faq_answer15">There are two types of Severe Weather Alerts: the rain alerts and wind alerts. The rain alerts are issued up to 24 hours in advance before a significant rain event begins to impact a certain location (except for localized thunderstorms). Wind alerts are usually released in tandem with our Tropical Cyclone updates once an area or location is expected to receive high winds (75kph and up). Our rain and wind alerts are posted here https://weatherph.org/category/newsroom/rain-and-wind-alerts/.</string>
    <string name="faq_answer16">Storm watches are issued by WPF’s Meteorological Team once a forecast suggests that there is a potential for significant wind and rain system to impact the Philippine land mass; this is released only every 24 hours. Moreover, it could be issued up to 48 hours prior to hitting land mass. This depends on the track and potential for intensification. Meanwhile, Tropical Cyclone Updates consist of weather information dedicated for Tropical Cyclones that would pose a threat or affect the country. Depending on the severity of the tropical cyclone, a 12-hourly or 6-hourly update is issued. Both Storm Watch and Tropical Cyclone Updates are found here: https://weatherph.org/category/newsroom/tropical-cyclone-update/</string>
    <string name="faq_answer17">A Daily Graphical Satellite (GraphSat) analysis involves the 24-hour graphical weather outlook issued on a daily basis to give our stakeholders an overview of what are the upcoming or existing weather systems that is currently affecting/may affect areas around the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).

Anonymous information refers to information that cannot lead to the identification (ID) of a specific individual. For example, we can see that a device with device ID A00001 is fetching weather information from location X. The device ID is randomly generated by either Google or Apple, and only Google or Apple can identify the user of the device. Weather Philippines Foundation, Inc. (WPFI or the “Owner”) cannot identify the user of the device.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The collected data, along with how it is used, stored and/or processed by the Owner, is detailed in this policy.&lt;/p></string>
