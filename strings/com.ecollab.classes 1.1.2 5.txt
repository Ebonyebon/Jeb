    <string name="terms_policy">Privacy Policy We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users while they interact with eCule APP (the “APP”). This Privacy Policy applies to the APP only. It does not apply to other websites to which we may link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE APP SIGNIFIES YOUR ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE APP. PLEASE ALSO READ OUR TERMS OF USE PAGE, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE USE, DISCLAIMERS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY GOVERNING THE USE OF THE APP. Information Collected We collect two types of information from you: information that you voluntarily provide to us and information that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.

In addition, we may also share your personally identifiable or other information with our affiliates for the purposes of improving our service quality. We may transfer personally identifiable information as an asset in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control. We may disclose contact information in special cases where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions of use or may be causing injury or interference with our rights, property, our customers or anyone who could be harmed by such activities. You will receive a prior notice when your personally identifiable information might be provided to any third party for any reason other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you will have the right to request that we not share such information and we will fully respect your decision.
