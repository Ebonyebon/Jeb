    <string name="IDS_day_sleep_content_1">Inadequate sleep at night can be supplemented by a nap during the day. In general, a nap before 1 pm lasting %1$d-%2$d minutes allows you to re-energize, improving clarity and efficiency in the afternoon.</string>
    <string name="IDS_day_sleep_content_2">However, naps should not exceed %1$s, otherwise you may enter the deep sleep stage. Your body temperature drops, and you can wake up feeling sleepy, dizzy, nauseous and experiencing other adverse symptoms. If you fall into deep sleep during the day, you may also experience difficulties falling asleep at night.</string>
    <string name="IDS_day_sleep_content_3">* Sleeping for less than %1$s at a time will be counted as a nap.</string>
    <string name="IDS_day_sleep_content_4">The most important part of the biological clock is the body temperature rhythm. When body temperature rises, you will feel more awake and when body temperature drops, you will feel tired. Temperatures fluctuate periodically throughout the day, rising in the morning, sometimes going down in the afternoon, and then rising until night. Therefore, it is best to nap in the afternoon (usually before 1 pm) when your body temperature is low, as the effect is best. If you nap too late in the day, the nap will interfere with your body temperature rhythm, affecting quality of sleep at night.</string>

Deep sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep, is the deepest sleep stage and the hardest to wake from. Being woken during this stage may result in dizziness, palpitations, and irritability. Research shows the deep sleep stage is the most effective for eliminating fatigue. Deep sleep is essential for stabilizing mood, balancing the mind, and restoring energy. Usually, more deep sleep means better quality sleep. But very high levels of deep sleep over a long period may be a symptom of illness. If in doubt, contact a medical professional.</string>

    <string name="IDS_details_night_sleep_content_2">Duration of sleep is not the only criterion that determines sleep quality, as demonstrated by the presence of long sleepers (≥ %1$s) and short sleepers (≤ %2$s) in the population. Sleeping less than the recommended amount should not be a cause for anxiety, as long as you wake up feeling refreshed. In addition, sleeping for a prolonged time does not necessarily make up for a lack of sleep and may negatively impact sleep quality.</string>
    <string name="IDS_details_night_sleep_content_3">Sleep is divided into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep also includes light sleep and deep sleep. REM sleep and NREM sleep occur alternatively, one alternation being a sleep cycle. Normal sleep throughout the night usually contains %1$d-%2$d sleep cycles. Each cycle lasts about %3$d-%4$d minutes, and is not a simple repetition of the previous cycle. In general, in the later sleep cycles, REM sleep time increases, and NREM sleep time decreases.</string>
    <string name="IDS_details_night_sleep_content_4">A typical sleep pattern goes through these transitions: Awakening → light sleep → deep sleep → light sleep → REM. However, in the actual process of sleep, you will not experience all these states of sleep, and conversion between these states is not fixed. For example, a person can transition directly from a state of light sleep, deep sleep, or REM to awakening.</string>

    <string name="IDS_details_sleep_content_1">Normal sleep architecture includes REM (rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. NREM sleep includes light sleep and deep sleep, and REM sleep is usually associated with dreaming. Huawei/Honor wearable devices are equipped with HUAWEI TruSleep™ sleep monitoring technology, which extracts normal sinus rhythm and respiratory signals from heart rate signals and uses the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) technology to analyze the coherence of these signals and their cross-spectral power for cardiopulmonary coupling analysis. This allows for accurate analysis for various stages of sleep, including deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep, and waking.</string>
    <string name="IDS_details_sleep_content_1_1">Note: HUAWEI TruSleep™ is a sleep monitoring technology certified by the Center for Dynamical Biomarkers (DBIOM) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.</string>
    <string name="IDS_details_sleep_content_2">Sleep quality index is used mainly to assess sleep quality. It is based on multiple parameters in the sleep structure, total sleep time and the proportion of each sleep stage are all important factors for calculating the sleep quality index. Among these factors, deep sleep is a significant factor in determining the sleep quality index. If deep sleep time is too short or fragmented, the brain cannot get adequate rest, which means even if overall sleep time is long, you will still feel drowsy and a lack of energy upon waking. The recommended ranges of sleep parameters for healthy adults are based on the statistical results of the Center for Dynamical Biomarkers (DBIOM) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, using CPC technology to analyze healthy adults in the SHHS database.</string>
    <string name="IDS_details_sleep_content_3">Poor quality sleep is usually the result of poor sleeping habits, such as irregular schedules, lack of sun exposure, lack of exercise, regular caffeine intake, drinking, or smoking. Sleep quality is also affected by psychological factors, physiological factors and environmental factors, such as anxiety, fatigue, bedroom lighting, noise, temperature and humidity.</string>
    <string name="IDS_details_sleep_content_4">Understanding the science behind sleep, analyzing and finding poor sleeping habits or psychological, physiological and environmental factors that negatively impact sleep, and making timely adjustments can improve sleep quality.

    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_1">In the light sleep stage, brain wave activity, heart rate, and breathing rate all slow down. In this sleep stage, it is easy to wake up. Being able to wake from sleep is a defense mechanism, essential to health and survival, and light sleep is a normal physiological need. Too much light sleep, though, can damage sleep quality and cause fatigue and difficulty waking.</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_2">Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended by the American College of Physicians (ACP) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia in adults. Clinical practice shows that chronic insomnia often have room for improvement in their sleeping habits. The Center for Dynamical Biomarkers (DBIOM) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, provides the following tips on improving sleep quality and getting more deep sleep:</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_3">(%1$d) Psychological factors: Excess energy, anxiety, mental tension, and depression can all disturb deep sleep. Balanced moods promote deep sleep and aid sleep quality.</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_4">(%1$d) Physiological factors: Excessive fatigue, or conditions with uncomfortable symptoms such as pain, itching and coughing, can all disturb deep sleep.</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_5">(%1$d) Environmental factors: Light, noise, and temperature and humidity levels can all disturb deep sleep. Creating a quiet, comfortable environment and choosing suitable bedding can help you sleep deeply.</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_6">(%1$d) Schedule: Shifts in work schedule, jet lag, or an irregular work/rest schedule can all disturb your biological clock and prevent you getting enough deep sleep. A regular sleep schedule helps your body clock work naturally and improves sleep quality.</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_7">(%1$d) Diet: Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and stimulating food can cause you to sleep too lightly. Following a balanced diet, avoiding caffeine after midday, and moderating alcohol and tobacco promotes deep sleep.</string>
    <string name="IDS_light_sleep_rate_content_8">(%1$d) Exercise: A suitable exercise schedule encourages deep sleep, as the body increases its rate of deep sleep in order to recover from the exercise. Strenuous exercise should be avoided close to bedtime, as it may make it difficult to fall asleep.</string>

    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_1">In the REM sleep phase, the human eye rapidly moves back and forth under the eyelids. Most people woken during this sleep stage say they are dreaming. During REM sleep, it is harder to wake than during light sleep, but easier to wake than during deep sleep. Muscles are usually paralyzed during REM sleep; this is a safety mechanism to prevent us acting out in our dreams, and also explains why feeling unable to run or shout is common in dreams.</string>
    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_2">Healthy REM sleep helps maintain mental well-being, boosts creativity, and relieves stress. Studies show that subjects are more likely to experience irritability, tension, and fatigue when deprived of REM sleep. Dreams mostly occur during REM sleep, and too many dreams can indicate that REM sleep accounts for too much of overall sleep. Dreaming often does not necessarily indicate poor sleep quality, rather it indicates that sleep was not deep enough, which results in easily-remembered dreams.</string>
    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_3">When REM levels are low, the body automatically catches up within a few nights. If you have excessive or insufficient levels of REM sleep over a long period, contact a medical professional, especially if you are also experiencing irritability, anxiety, or similar symptoms.</string>
    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_4">The Center for Dynamical Biomarkers (DBIOM) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, provides the following tips on getting the right amount of REM sleep:</string>
    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_5">(%1$d) Schedule: REM sleep usually lasts longer in the second half of the night. Maintaining a regular schedule by waking up and going to bed early can help.</string>
    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_6">(%1$d) Psychological factors: Avoiding extreme anxiety or fatigue and handling daily stressors efficiently can help to maintain normal levels of REM sleep.</string>
    <string name="IDS_slum_sleep_rate_content_7">(%1$d) Diet: Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and medication can negatively impact the amount of REM sleep you get, resulting in REM sleep accounting for too little of overall sleep.</string>

    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_1">The causes of nocturnal awakenings are complicated. Nocturnal awakenings can last for a short duration or a long duration. Nocturnal awakenings are connected to sleep obstruction, a lack of sleep, oversleeping, and other causes. Under normal circumstances, nocturnal awakenings should occur less than %1$s, and the total nocturnal awakening time should be within %2$s of total sleep time. If nocturnal awakenings occur frequently, it is generally considered insomnia. Tests indicate that the deep sleep duration of insomniacs is significantly lower than that of the normal sleepers, and even when the insomniac sleeps for normal amounts of time, there is poor physical recovery after waking up.</string>
    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_2">If you wake up often during the night and find it difficult to go back to sleep, all while experiencing adverse symptoms, you can consult the Center for Dynamical Biomarkers (DBIOM) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, to analyze and find out the reasons for your problems so that you can quickly correct them.</string>
    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_3">"(%1$d) Develop regular lifestyle habits and strengthen the body's circadian rhythm. Go to bed on time, and get up on time the next day even if you could not sleep at night. Receive adequate sunlight during the day, and avoid naps that are too long."</string>
    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_4">(%1$d) Avoid activities that require intense brain activity before going to bed. For example, while you are in bed, do not watch TV, use your mobile phone, or go over problems. Go to bed relaxed and in a calm emotional state.</string>
    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_5">(%1$d) Develop a correct understanding of sleep and do not enlarge the consequences of poor sleep. If you wake up at night, do not get overly anxious, do not frequently look at the time, and relax.</string>
    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_6">(%1$d) The bedroom environment should be comfortable, with suitable temperatures, and without noise and light.</string>
    <string name="IDS_wake_times_content_7">(%1$d) Maintain regular, moderate intensity exercise (such as jogging), as increases in body temperatures through exercise can promote sleep at night. However, avoid intense exercises before going to bed, as being in a state of excitement and having body temperatures that are too high may make it difficult to fall asleep.</string>

Welcome to Huawei Health.

The following terms in this Huawei Health agreement (this \"Agreement\") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Hereafter referred to as \"Huawei\"). This Agreement stipulates your legal rights and responsibilities relating to the use of Huawei Health, and the relevant software, services, and websites (this \"Service\"). In this Agreement, \"you\" refers to any individual that uses and/or accesses this Service.

Before using this Service, you must agree to the terms in this Agreement, Huawei's Privacy Policy and any corresponding agreements made between you and Huawei (these \"Terms\"). Please ensure that you read the following terms carefully and select the check box at the bottom to indicate that you have read and agree to these terms. If you do not agree to all or part of the terms, you will not be able to use, nor should you attempt to use this Service.

1. Data protection

Huawei respects and protects the personal privacy of all Huawei Health users as well as your personal information (such as your nickname, profile picture, gender, age, telephone number, or email address) and your personal health data (such as exercise, sleep, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, and heart rate data). Huawei will not disclose, transfer or provide such information to any third party without your prior consent unless relevant laws and regulations require its forceful disclosure. Huawei will not use, nor does it have the intention of using exercise, weight, sleep and/or other data stored on the cloud for other purposes. Information is only stored on the cloud to ensure data security.

2. Third-party services

Your carrier or other third parties may also provide corresponding products and services on Huawei's Health platform, such as third-party apps and service content. By using such third-party products and services, you acknowledge that you agree to the service terms stipulated by the third party. We strongly recommend that you read the content of third-party user agreements and privacy policies carefully. Huawei is neither entitled to nor obliged to control or censor the content of third-party products and services, therefore Huawei shall assume no liability in the event that your rights are infringed due to using such products and services.

3. Data authorization and collection

In order to provide you with a more stable product and customized service, Huawei and third-party service providers that cooperate with Huawei on Huawei Health (such as Chunyu Doctor and Guahao.com) will collect error information and/or data relating to your product. By selecting \"Agree\" in the popup message when launching the Huawei Health app or by using Huawei Health, you agree to and authorize Huawei to collect and analyze the following information: (1) device information, such as the phone operating system, phone language, device model, phone Internet connection mode and location information; (2) app information, such as the app version, app download method, and the time that the app was opened or closed; (3) service data, such as app error information and service activation information; (4) personal health data, including but not limited to exercise, sleep, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate data. Please abide by Clause 2 in these Terms if you have agreed to third parties processing your information.

In order to prevent your data from being lost, Huawei Health will automatically enable the sync to cloud feature, which will upload your exercise, sleep, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate data to the cloud at regular intervals. Data synced to the cloud cannot be deleted in batches and will be stored permanently. If you do not want your data to be uploaded to the cloud automatically, you can disable the auto-sync feature by selecting \"Settings\" in Huawei Health and then turning off the \"Auto-sync\" switch.

In order to improve your experience of using Huawei products, Huawei Health will automatically share the exercise data that you have authorized Huawei to collect with other Huawei products by default, such as Smartcare. Likewise, other Huawei products related to health and exercise (such as Huawei Wear) will by default share exercise data that you have authorized Huawei to collect with Huawei Health. You can disable the automatic sharing of data between Huawei Health and other Huawei products at any time by selecting \"Settings\" in Huawei Health and then selecting the disable option in \"Data sources\".

In order to prevent unnecessary disturbances to you when using Huawei Health, please authorize Huawei Health to automatically enable and/or disable Bluetooth.

Personal information that you have authorized Huawei to collect will be handled according to Huawei's Privacy Policy. Please read the contents of this Privacy Policy carefully. You can view the Privacy Policy by selecting \"Huawei Privacy Policy\" in the popup message that appears when launching Huawei Health, or by visiting http://consumer.huawei.com/en/privacy-policy/index.htm.
