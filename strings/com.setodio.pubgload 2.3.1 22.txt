This might not sound like too many, but keep in mind they can potentially kill 20 players.

Keep in mind, the crossbow does have a scope on its own, which is superior to red dot or holographic sights. The quiver decreases the awfully long reload time to a little less awful.

It is a five-rounds bolt-action rifle. Reloading requires quite a bit of time, unless it is completely empty, since every bullet has to be loaded individually. It deals a lot of damage and the bullet flies quite fast and uses 7.62 ammo, which you find quite regularly. It can be upgraded with bullet loops which decrease the reload time. Scopes and any barrel extension are also useable.

What sets this gun apart from every other in the game is the burst-fire mode. It rapidly shoots three bullets, the first at the point where you are aiming and the other two slightly above. Aim for the chest for maximum potential. It uses 5.56 ammo which it shares with the M4A4, SCAR-L and the M249.

    <string name="m249_desc">"The M249 is very fun to use. 100×5.56 rounds in a magazine. You can attach any scope on it and happily fire away. The only fire mode is full-auto, so you will have to be careful. Shoot for too long and the recoil becomes unbearable. It deals a lot of damage which suffices from far away. It’s a light machine gun and you get what you expect.

    <string name="m24_desc">"The M24 is a bolt-action sniper you can only find in Airdrops. It deals more damage than the Kar98k while being able to be equipped the same way as the SKS. Additionally, it is a very good sniper rifle and fires 7.62 ammo. If you want to be able to fire a couple more rounds, it makes an ideal sniper rifle as well.

The M416 be upgraded with a tactical stock which further reduces recoil. This could be wrong, yet it feels like the SCAR-L has less recoil compared to an M416 with a tactical stock. The M4 is my personal favorite.

It excels at close range as it has a very fast fire rate. Each hit deals little damage, but the rate of fire balances this out. It is very hard to hit a target at long to medium ranges, due to the bullet spread. It makes the bullets fly anywhere except where you are aiming at. The Uzi fires 9mm bullets, just like the UMP-45 and the P92. A stock can be attached to the Uzi, any magazine add-on, as well as any attachment for the barrel.

The base magazine size is five and can be upgraded to eight using an extended mag.

    <string name="s1897_desc">"The S1897 is a pump-action shotgun with a five-shell tube. It takes long to reload completely and there is quite some delay between each shot. Missing one shot can potentially end deadly but the five shells you have before you’ve gotta reload are rather handy short engagements. You can interrupt the reload at any time to shoot, if you have at least one shell loaded. It can equip bullet loops which decrease the time to reload and a choke reducing spread.

It only holds two shells, the short time to reload balances this out, though. Just like the pump-action, it can add on choke and bullet loops.

    <string name="scar_l_desc">"The SCAR-L is regarded as an all-purpose rifle. It has a good rate of fire, deals as much damage as the M16 and has an excellent range. It has a wider range of attachments, too. Unlike the AK and M16, the SCAR-L can equip a vertical or angled foregrip, reducing vertical and horizontal recoil. The iron sights of the SCAR-L are excellent and usable even at medium range. It is very hard to hit someone at medium range with the iron sights on any other AR.

Well, aside from basically anything. A decked-out vector is way, way better than the Tommy Gun. It’s quite fun to mess around with, that’s all. You usually curse finding the M249 or Tommy Gun because it COULD have been a sniper but it wasn’t. You risked your life for basically 100 rounds of .45 ACP.

    <string name="vector_desc">"The KRISS Vector is one beast of an SMG. It fires more powerful bullets, the .45 ACPs. The Vector can use the same attachments as the UMP-45. In addition, it can use the buttstock the M416 is able to equip. The only problem is the comparably small size of Vector’s magazine with only 13 rounds. An extended mag, which boosts it up to 25 rounds, is a must. It fires faster than the UMP, has less recoil and deals more damage. Because of that it is much rarer to find.

The damage is nothing to brag about but it is decent. The silencer is very good, little sound will be sent to your enemy, which makes it the perfect gun for the top 10. 9mm ammo is very common and easy to find. What is more, the VSS can switch to full-auto. It is hard to control but satisfying if you hit. The magazine can be upgraded with an extended mag, boosting the rounds per magazine to 20. I cannot tell whether I like it or not, as yet.

    <string name="license_cc0_10_licenseDescription">"&lt;strong>&lt;i>Statement of Purpose&lt;/i>&lt;/strong> &lt;br />&lt;br /> The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\"). &lt;br />&lt;br /> Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. &lt;br />&lt;br /> For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.&lt;/strong> A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;ol type=\"i\"> &lt;li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;&lt;/li>&lt;br /> &lt;li>moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);&lt;/li>&lt;br /> &lt;li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;&lt;/li>&lt;br /> &lt;li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;&lt;/li>&lt;br /> &lt;li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;&lt;/li>&lt;br /> &lt;li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and&lt;/li>&lt;br /> &lt;li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.&lt;/li> &lt;/ol> &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;strong>2. Waiver.&lt;/strong> To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;strong>3. Public License Fallback.&lt;/strong> Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\").

License Grant.&lt;/b> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: &lt;br />&lt;br /> • to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; &lt;br />&lt;br /> • to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; &lt;br />&lt;br /> • to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, &lt;br />&lt;br /> • to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • For the avoidance of doubt: &lt;br /> • &lt;b>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes&lt;/b>. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; &lt;br />&lt;br /> • &lt;b>Waivable Compulsory License Schemes&lt;/b>. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, &lt;br />&lt;br /> • &lt;b>Voluntary License Schemes&lt;/b>. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>4. Restrictions.&lt;/b> The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: &lt;br /> • You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer&lt;/b> &lt;br />&lt;br /> UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>6. Limitation on Liability.&lt;/b> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>7. Termination&lt;/b> &lt;br /> • This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br/> &lt;b>8. Miscellaneous&lt;/b> &lt;br /> • Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law. &lt;br />&lt;br />"</string>

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). • Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.&lt;/b> • The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. &lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>Section 6 – Term and Termination.&lt;/b> &lt;br /> • This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. • Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: &lt;br /> • automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or • upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. &lt;br />&lt;br /> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. &lt;br />&lt;br /> • For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. • Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.&lt;/b> &lt;br /> • The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. • Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>Section 8 – Interpretation.&lt;/b> &lt;br /> • For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. • To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. • No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. • Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority."</string>

Additional Definitions.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&lt;br /> 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /> 2. Conveying Modified Versions.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:&lt;br /> &lt;br /> a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&lt;br /> b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&lt;br /> &lt;br /> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&lt;br /> b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 4. Combined Works.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:&lt;br /> &lt;br /> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&lt;br /> b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&lt;br /> c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&lt;br /> d) Do one of the following:&lt;br /> 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.&lt;br /> 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.&lt;br /> e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 5. Combined Libraries.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:&lt;br /> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.&lt;br /> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.&lt;br />"</string>

    <string name="license_lgpl_3_0_licenseShortDescription">"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /> &lt;br /> Version 3, 29 June 2007&lt;br /> &lt;br /> Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/>&lt;br /> &lt;br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional Definitions.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&lt;br /> 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&lt;br /> 2. Conveying Modified Versions.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:&lt;br /> &lt;br /> a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&lt;br /> b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&lt;br /> &lt;br /> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&lt;br /> b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 4. Combined Works.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:&lt;br /> &lt;br /> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&lt;br /> b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&lt;br /> c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&lt;br /> d) Do one of the following:&lt;br /> 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.&lt;br /> 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.&lt;br /> e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 5. Combined Libraries.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:&lt;br /> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.&lt;br /> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&lt;br /> &lt;br /> 6.
