    <string name="about_us_text">"Not long ago, in a far off land (Los Angeles, CA), the frustration of finding a new place to live became so unbearable that Jonathan Eppers, Tyler Galpin, and Tim Watson quit their full time jobs to build what has become known as RadPad.

Our original plan was just to build the friendliest mobile experience to help renters find their RadPad; but our vision has since expanded to encompass all aspects of renting.

Like you, we're also renters and often find that our own pains and frustrations of renting turn in to the very features you'll find on RadPad.

In the last year and a half we've grown from three to a team of 14, moved to an office near the beach and even fended off baseless lawsuits from competitors who sought to slow us down.

We're nowhere close to being done and our greatest hope is that RadPad makes your life just a little better.

If you ever have a suggestion or want us to think about something that we could do to make RadPad better, please let us know (feedback@onradpad.com). We're always listening.


Onwards!
