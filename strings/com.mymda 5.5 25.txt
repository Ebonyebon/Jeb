    <string name="eula_00p01">This end user license agreement (this “EULA”) is a legal agreement between Epic Systems Corporation (“Epic”) and You regarding Your installation and use of the Epic program entitled “MyChart” (the “Application”).

    <string name="eula_00p02">The Application is designed to operate with the Android operating system (“Licensed OS”). The Application enables end users to access, review and use certain data provided by a connection to an instance of Epic’s server edition of MyChart licensed by a third party (typically Your medical provider) under a separate agreement with Epic. Nothing in this EULA gives You any right or license to the server edition of the Application.</string>
    <string name="eula_01">1. SCOPE OF LICENSE.</string>
    <string name="eula_01p01">a. Subject to Your compliance with the terms of this EULA, Epic grants to You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license to use the Application on Your device running the Licensed OS solely for the purpose of performing those functions and tasks available to You as an end user of the Application.

This EULA is revocable at will, by either party, upon written notice to the other. Your use of the Application is strictly limited as provided in this EULA. No other use of the Application is permitted.</string>
    <string name="eula_01p02">b. Epic reserves all ownership and intellectual property rights in and to the Application. The Application and any updates, upgrades or derivative works to the Application are, and will remain, the copyrighted work of Epic. The Application is licensed to You; not sold. This EULA gives You some limited rights to use the Application, and Epic reserves all other rights.</string>
    <string name="eula_01p03">c. In addition, You acknowledge certain optional features and functionality enabled through the Application may be provided pursuant to a license with a third party licensor. Your use of those features and functionalities may be subject to the terms of a third party license agreement to which You must agree before using such features or functionalities.</string>
    <string name="eula_01p04">d. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided to You by Epic that replace and/or supplement the Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license agreement in which case the terms of the new license will govern, and You agree to promptly install any such upgrade and cease use of the prior version.</string>
    <string name="eula_02">2. LICENSE LIMITATIONS.</string>
    <string name="eula_02p01">a. You will not: (1) publish, discuss, release, broadcast or otherwise disseminate to any third party, the results of any benchmark or comparison tests run with the Application, without the written permission of Epic; (2) work around technical limitations in the Application, including any access restrictions; (3) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Application, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits; (4) incorporate the Application into any other software product; (5) use the Application in any manner that is illegal, unlawful or abusive including, without limitation, to commit or promote any fraud or identity theft, to send or originate any threatening or harassing materials, to initiate or participate in any denial of service or hacking or cracking, to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, or defame any third party, or to store, send or receive any content that infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property or other proprietary rights; (6) rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Application to any third party; (7) modify, alter or create any derivative work of the Application; or (8) remove or obscure or alter any copyright notice or other proprietary rights notice (including the Epic logo) from the Application.</string>
    <string name="eula_02p02">b. If You breach the restrictions of this EULA, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. You acknowledge that Epic may audit Your use of the Application.</string>
    <string name="eula_03">3. COLLECTION OF DATA.</string>
    <string name="eula_03p01">a. You agree that Epic and any organization that You access through Your use of the Application (each such organization, “Your MyChart Provider”) may collect, store, process, maintain, upload, sync, transmit, share, disclose and otherwise use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Application as well as personal information, user location data, and user content (all such data, collectively, “User Data”). Epic and Your MyChart Provider may use User Data to improve its products, to provide services or technologies to You, and to facilitate the provision of services or functionality for the Application, including, but not limited to authentication, performance optimization, software updates, product support and other services to You related to the Application.</string>
    <string name="eula_03p02">b. You acknowledge that use of the Application may result in User Data being transmitted between Your device and a database server designated by Your MyChart Provider and that such User Data may be collected, stored, processed, maintained and used by Your MyChart Provider and/or transmitted or disclosed to or accessed by Epic. More specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, You acknowledge that Your MyChart Provider may collect, transmit, and store: (1) Your device identification and such identification may be used in order to allow Your device to connect to the relevant database(s) that Your MyChart Provider makes accessible to end users of the Application and may be accessed by Epic in connection with troubleshooting; (2) information regarding the hardware model of the device on which you are running the Application and may be used to make changes, updates or improvements to or to optimize the performance of the Application or to otherwise inform future development and may be transmitted to Epic and may be used by Epic for the same; and (3) audit logs reflecting Your logins, logouts and the activities You have accessed through Your use of the Application and such audit logs may be and may also be made available to Epic for troubleshooting.</string>
    <string name="eula_03p03">c. BY CLICKING ON THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE FOREGOING COLLECTION, STORAGE, PROCESSING, MAINTENANCE, UPLOADING, SYNCING, TRANSMITTING, SHARING, OR DISCLOSURE OF USER DATA. By continuing to use the Application, You indicate Your continued consent to such collection, storage, processing, maintenance, uploading, syncing, transmitting, sharing, or disclosure of User Data as well as any collection, storage, transmission and use of data of the type and in the manner described in the “About” box, if any, located within the Application.</string>
    <string name="eula_04">4. THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND MATERIALS.</string>
    <string name="eula_04p01">a. The Application may enable access to Epic and third party services and systems, including those of Your MyChart Provider (collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of the Services may require Internet access and that You accept additional terms of service. Your use of such Services is conditioned upon Your acceptance of such terms.</string>
    <string name="eula_04p02">b. You further understand that by using any of the Services, You may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, Your access to and use of the Services is at Your sole risk, and Epic shall not have any liability to You for such content.</string>
    <string name="eula_04p03">c. In addition, certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties or provide links to certain third party web sites, including Your MyChart Provider (“Third Party Materials”). By using the Services, You acknowledge and agree that Epic is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials. Epic does not warrant or endorse and does not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to You or any other person for any Services, Third Party Materials. Third Party Materials are provided solely as a convenience to You. Neither Epic, nor any of its content providers, guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of any information or data displayed by any Services.</string>
    <string name="eula_04p04">d. In addition, Epic makes no representation that such Services or Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location at any particular time. If You choose to access any Services or Third Party Materials, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. Epic reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services or Third Party Materials at any time without notice. In no event will Epic be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services or Third Party Materials. Epic may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services or Third Party Materials, in any case and without notice or liability.</string>
    <string name="eula_04p05">e. You agree that any Services and Third Party Materials may contain proprietary content, information and material that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the Services or Third Party Materials.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION, SERVICES AND THIRD PARTY MATERIALS (AND YOUR RELIANCE ON THE OPERATION, OUTPUT OR RESULTS THEREFROM) ARE LICENSED “AS-IS, WHERE-IS, AS-AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS. EPIC AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS AND DISTRIBUTORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THE APPLICATION, THE SERVICES AND THE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY THAT USE OF THE APPLICATION, SERVICES OR THIRD PARTY MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES AND/OR THIRD PARTY MATERIALS, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</string>
    <string name="eula_05p02">b. In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty (whether by operation of law or otherwise), as Your sole and exclusive remedy, You may return the Application and request a refund of the amount You paid for the Application, if any, within 48 hours from the time You downloaded it.</string>
    <string name="eula_06">6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</string>
    <string name="eula_06p01">a. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EPIC OR ITS LICENSORS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION, THE SERVICES AND/OR THE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Epic’s or Epic’s licensors’ or distributors’ total, aggregate liability to You for damages exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.</string>
    <string name="eula_07">7. NO-EXPORT; GOVERNMENT USERS</string>
    <string name="eula_07p01">a. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained.

    <string name="eula_08p01">a. Except as expressly provided in subsection (b) below, You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Epic harmless from any claims, damages or liabilities, regardless of the cause, including Epic’s negligence, arising out of or relating to Your use, operation, installation, configuration, uninstalling, and/or reliance upon the results generated, or information transmitted, by the Application. To the extent applicable, You will obtain Epic’s prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which You agree to any finding of fault of Epic or defect in the Application.

    <string name="eula_08p02">b. Provided that You have used the Application in accordance with the terms of this EULA and You promptly notify Epic of any claim against You of the type described below, Epic will indemnify, defend, and hold You harmless from any such claim brought against You to the extent that: (1) it is a claim that the licensed use of the then-current version of the Application infringes any third party’s patent, copyright, or trademark, in each case enforceable in the United States; (2) the claim is based on the use of the Application in the form supplied to You by Epic; and (3) the claim is not based on the use of the Application in combination with other hardware or software except to the extent the use of the Application alone would constitute an infringement. You will promptly notify Epic in writing of the claim, promptly provide Epic with the information reasonably required for the defense of the same, and grant to Epic exclusive control over its defense and settlement. Epic may at its sole option and expense: (i) procure the right for You to continue to use the Application; (ii) modify or replace the Application or such portion thereof as Epic deems appropriate; or (iii) terminate Your license to the Application and refund any fees You paid for use of the Application.

    <string name="eula_09">9. STIPULATION OF REASONABILITY.</string>
    <string name="eula_09p01">The Application is provided to You free of charge. Because of this, You agree that sections 5, 6, and 8 of this EULA are reasonable.

While we provide this access as a service to you, reading the information could raise questions or reveal information that you do not understand.

Therefore, you may want to get new information only from your doctor and health team. Or you may choose to review your personal health record during regular working hours. That way, you may call and schedule an appointment to talk about your questions.

Your doctor and clinic staff are available to answer your questions Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Central Standard Time."</string>
