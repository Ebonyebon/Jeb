1. The following Terms of Use in their currently amended version (hereinafter referred to as \"Terms of Use\"), in conjunction with the data security policy, govern the use of the App (hereinafter referred to as “App“) developed by PREVENTICUS (PREVENTICUS GmbH, Tatzendpromenade 2, 07745 Jena, Germany, hereinafter referred to as “PREVENTICUS“) and the utilization of the services offered by PREVENTICUS vis-à-vis its consumers (as defined by Section 13 of the German Civil Code (BGB)).

2. These Terms of Use shall apply exclusively.


II. CONCLUSION OF CONTRACT
1. By the User agreeing to these Terms of Use, a contractual relationship shall be deemed to have been entered into by and between PREVENTICUS and the User; said contract shall be free-of-charge and contingent upon these general Terms of Use.

2. Upon agreement with these Terms of Use, the User shall be given the option of utilizing services that are free-of-charge (hereinafter referred to as “free”) as well as subject to payment (hereinafter referred to as “paid”). These Terms of Use shall likewise exclusively govern services that are both free-of-charge and subject to payment.

3. Prior to entering into the contract relating to paid services, PREVENTICUS shall inform the User about the contents of the respective services, the applicable pricing and the terms and conditions of payment. The user shall select a means of payment, for example, by entering their payment data on the payment site, by transmitting their payment data to PREVENTICUS, to the e-payment provider commissioned by PREVENTICUS or by entering a voucher code.


III. SUBJECT OF THE CONTRACT
1. Within the scope of preclinical risk screening functionalities, PREVENTICUS offers its users services that gather and provision their health data by applying PREVENTICUS algorithms to the evaluation of said data. The User provides the details by manual entry and deployment of a mobile terminal device (smartphone, iPod). PREVENTICUS applies analytical algorithms to the details and measured values provided by the User to generate individualized, user-related findings; said findings are provided by PREVENTICUS to the User in the form of a findings report.

2. Medical diagnostics, telemedicine or physician-contracted services are not the subject of the contractual relationship between PREVENTICUS and the User.


IV. INFORMATION

Within the meaning of these Terms of Use, Information of the User is defined to include the data,

• which the User has provided either by manual entry or otherwise after the personal deployment of measuring devices, in particular, their baseline data,

• their personal findings obtained by PREVENTICUS


V.  FULL-SERVICE PACKAGE – FREE AND PAID SERVICES RENDERED BY PREVENTICUS
1. \"Basic Use\" service package - free services

A short-term measurement, including the generation of a brief analysis based on the entered and measured data, is free of charge. The “Basic Use” package offers no detailed analysis, no options for storing the findings and no functionalities that communicate with third parties via the App.

2. \"Premium Use\" full-service package – paid services

a) The \"Premium Use\" package is subject to payment.

b) The scope of the \"Premium Use\" package includes the \"Basic Use\" package by the User plus

- a 5-minute measurement including a detailed analysis

- the option to generate, store and transmit a comprehensive analysis report.

c) The paid \"Premium Use\" package shall expire upon termination of the contract. Upon expiration of the “Premium Use” contract, free “Basic Use” shall continue in force with the aforementioned limited analysis and interactive options.


VI. SCOPE OF SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY PREVENTICUS
1. PREVENTICUS is not obligated to examine or verify the accuracy, completeness or up-to-dateness of the data reported by users. For the performance of its services, PREVENTICUS may impute that the data provided by the User are correct, complete and up-to-date. If the data provided by the User are not correct, complete or up-to-date, the User must automatically accept the fact that the findings obtained by PREVENTICUS may not be applicable. The analyses, therefore, must always be deemed of limited conclusiveness and make no claim to completeness or accuracy. PREVENTICUS therefore assumes no warranty or guarantee for the accuracy and/or completeness of the results and other details, and in particular, not in a medical or clinical sense.

2. The findings obtained by PREVENTICUS are exclusively intended for information purposes. Every analysis is abstract and therefore always constitutes non-binding information, containing neither details on the actual health condition of the User nor advice nor recommendations relating to the treatment of diseases or frailties. Such information, advice or recommendations can only be provided by a physician or other medically or therapeutically trained personnel. PREVENTICUS is not capable of administering any medical or other specialized care- or health-related examinations and is not obligated to perform said services. The respective analysis is no substitute for the medical history, examination, diagnosis or therapeutic recommendations rendered by a physician. The findings obtained do not represent a diagnosis and therefore under no circumstances do they replace or supplement personal consultation, care or treatment by medical or other medically trained specialized personnel, who render the diagnosis, recommend treatment strategies or administer medication. The analyses merely deliver non-binding indicators of potential risks. No analysis is a substitute for a doctor's examination. PREVENTICUS is not obligated to render a conclusive health risk assessment and/or therapeutic decisions. A risk may indeed exist even though a finding does not indicate any risk. PREVENTICUS shall not assume any health care for the User. PREVENTICUS therefore expressly requests all Users to always obtain medical and/or a physician's advice without delay in the case of disease symptoms or health problems. PREVENTICUS hereby expressly advises against initiating, changing or ending any therapeutic interventions until consultation with a physician.

3. PREVENTICUS shall apply the utmost care and rely on the identifiably most current medical trends to verify details when rendering its services. PREVENTICUS provides no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, up-to-dateness or usefulness of these data.

4. Whether and how the User utilizes the analyses is at his own risk. PREVENTICUS and its executive bodies, executives, employees, vicarious agents, partners, affiliates and licensors assume no responsibility whatsoever for decisions made by you based on the website and/or the Information, such as decisions as to whether or not to consult caregivers or accept treatment by medical or healthcare professionals. You hereby waive all and any claims you have or may have in the future against PREVENTICUS and its executive bodies, executives, employees, vicarious agents, partners, affiliates and licensors and herewith declare to hold the aforementioned harmless from any claims, litigation, costs or for any direct or indirect damages arising in connection with the use of the Information. This also applies to lost earnings.

5. No agency or commissioned relationship exists between PREVENTICUS and the User.

6. PREVENTICUS makes no representations or gives any guarantees whatsoever that the App's operation is reliable, interruption- and error-free. PREVENTICUS assumes no obligation with regard to the functional suitability or functionality of the smartphone or other hardware employed by the User.


VII. PAYMENT, VOUCHERS
1. The User hereby agrees to have payment transactions for the paid services rendered by PREVENTICUS carried out by a service provider commissioned by PREVENTICUS (e.g. e-payment provider or credit card company). The User may use any conventional and reasonable payment modality that is free-of-charge.

2. If the User selects a PREVENTICUS voucher code as means of payment for a paid service, the terms and conditions stated below shall apply:

a) PREVENTICUS shall accept purchased vouchers issued to the private User as payment for the fulfillment of specific services.

b) The right to redemption expires in accordance with the redemption period specified on the voucher. Every voucher may only be redeemed once. Vouchers cannot be combined. PREVENTICUS shall not replace a voucher in the event it is lost. The monetary value of the vouchers cannot be paid out.

c) Vouchers may not be resold. It is particularly not allowed to offer the voucher for sale on web-based auction platforms. Vouchers acquired by these means become void and invalid, thereby releasing PREVENTICUS from its obligation to redeem them. PREVENTICUS is therefore entitled to revoke acceptance of the voucher. Employees of cooperating partner enterprises and their family members are excluded from the use of voucher codes.


VIII. RESTRICTIONS ON USE, BANS ON ACCESS
1. The following types of use and access are prohibited:

a) The use of the App for purposes that are illegal, particularly for purposes that are in contravention of the law or of this contract or promotion of such unlawful or contraventional purposes. The above shall also apply to any attempts to do so

b) Access to, manipulation of or use of non-public domains of the App, of computer systems of PREVENTICUS or of the technical transfer systems of our providers

c) Probing, scanning or testing the vulnerability of the App or breaching or circumventing security and authentication measures

d) All automatic or manual attempts to access the App or its information and data or to search the App using any other than the currently available public interfaces of PREVENTICUS

e) Any disruption or interruption of the access to the App through other users as well as corresponding attempts

f) The use, gathering, spying or forwarding of third-party data or information without their express permission, proof of which must be provided to PREVENTICUS under all circumstances

g) Every modification, linking, deep-linkage, storage, reproduction, duplication, copy, sale or trade with the contents or graphic design of the App or the information contained thereon.

2. Furthermore, the User is prohibited from

b) carrying out disruptive interventions with technical or electronic assistive devices in the PREVENTICUS system or undertaking such attempts, particularly using hacking, brute force attacks, viruses, worms or Trojans

c) reading, copying, distributing or transmitting accessible data without the express permission of the respective titleholder or downloading said data with automated programs (crawlers, bots)

d) sending chain letters or messages, in particular, bulk e-mails or spam, to several persons at the same time.

3. In the event of a breach of any obligation hereunder or of corresponding attempts, PREVENTICUS is entitled to withhold or remove information or any other data as well as to terminate paid services at any time with good cause.


IX. MODIFICATIONS TO THE APP, CONTENTS
1. PREVENTICUS reserves the right to change the contents, the graphic design or the structure of the App. For that purpose or for other reasons, PREVENTICUS furthermore reserves the right to temporarily suspend complete or partial access to the App, its operation or its functions at any time.

2. PREVENTICUS is responsible for proprietary content on the PREVENTICUS website as well as the App in accordance with general laws. PREVENTICUS is not obligated to monitor transmitted, linked or stored external information or to search for circumstances that point to any illegal activity. Any obligations for the removal or blocking of the use of information pursuant to general laws shall remain unaffected thereby. Any liability in this respect, however, shall only apply after the time a concrete violation of the law became known. If PREVENTICUS become aware of content-related legal infringements, PREVENTICUS shall remove such content without delay.


X. RIGHTS TO THE WEBSITE, THE APP, BRANDS AND NAMES
1. All rights to the website and the App, specifically copyrights, brands, patents and all other intellectual property rights as well as all rights to the name \"PREVENTICUS\" or easily confusable derivatives, to labels, domains and all information (with the exception of the individual details entered by the User) are and shall always remain exclusively with PREVENTICUS and/or its licensors.

2. Any reproduction, processing, distribution or type of utilization of any content or parts of the website as well as use of the App are subject to the written permission of PREVENTICUS. Downloads and copies of the website or the App for commercial use are not permitted.

3. To the extent that PREVENTICUS has not generated the content on the PREVENTICUS website or the App, PREVENTICUS shall observe the copyrights of third parties. Third-party content is labeled as such. If, in spite of the aforementioned, users should become aware of any copyright violations, we request that they please notify PREVENTICUS of the fact. Should PREVENTICUS become aware of such violations of the law, we shall immediately remove the affected contents.


XI. LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF PREVENTICUS
1. PREVENTICUS shall bear unlimited liability for willful intent or gross negligence. In the event of minor negligence, PREVENTICUS's liability shall only be limited to damages typical to this type of contract that could reasonably have been foreseen insofar as PREVENTICUS has breached a duty that is of essential importance for achieving the purpose of the agreement. Irrespective of the reason for the claim, PREVENTICUS shall assume no liability beyond this. The aforementioned liability restrictions and exclusions shall not apply to claims arising from damage from injury to life, body or health or for claims under the Product Liability Act. Unless the liability of PREVENTICUS is limited or excluded, the personal liability or any other of its vicarious agents of PREVENTICUS are likewise limited and/or excluded. The aforementioned liability restrictions shall also apply vis-à-vis third parties who fall under the protective purview of the contract.

2. PREVENTICUS is neither responsible nor liable for damage to the computer system of the User, the loss of data or other disadvantages arising from access to the website or to the App or their respective use. This also applies to the destruction or any failed storage or transfer of data, information and other messages.


XII. DATA PROTECTION AND SECURITY
1. PREVENTICUS is committed to its concern for safeguarding Users' data. The User can read more about the topic of data protection in PREVENTICUS's data security policy. The gathering, processing and utilization of the data provided by the User as well as the security and protection of the data and information shall be governed by the statutory regulations as well as by the data security policy of PREVENTICUS.

2. At PREVENTICUS, no sale, exchange or other unauthorized use of personal data and information takes place. PREVENTICUS shall not pass on the Users' personal data to third parties unless the Users have given their permission to do so or PREVENTICUS is compelled to turn over data under a statutory obligation. External service providers commissioned by PREVENTICUS who render services relating to the fulfillment of this agreement with the User in the name and under the commission of PREVENTICUS do not count as third parties. External service providers include payment providers, collection agencies and e-mail or newsletter distributors, among others.

DATA SECURITY POLICY

The present data security policy (in its currently amended version; hereinafter referred to as \"Data security policy\" for short) details the principles and procedures governing the gathering, utilization and forwarding of the data we obtain when you use the App operated by PREVENTICUS GmbH, Tatzendpromenade 2, 07745 Jena, Germany (“PREVENTICUS“). The use of the App is subject to these Terms of Use. PREVENTICUS has put this data security policy in place to demonstrate our commitment to ensuring the private sphere and security of the data provided to us, in accordance with our obligations within the scope of prevailing laws, regulations and statutes. By using our services, you agree to accept the currently amended version of this data security policy. If you are not in agreement therewith then you will be prohibited from accessing our services.

1.\u0009Germany enforces a strict data protection regime. The fact that your data will be analyzed on a professionally administrated, secure data storage server in Germany means that your information will be processed in compliance and accordance with the data protection principles in Germany. If you access the website from a computer situated outside of Germany, you hereby agree and allow PREVENTICUS to transmit your data to you outside of Germany as well. If, for whatever reason, PREVENTICUS is required to transmit data to a country with inadequate data protection standards, PREVENTICUS shall ensure by means of suitable contractual obligations that your data are protected.

2.\u0009By using this App, you agree to the gathering, transmission, modification and other usage of your data. Irrespective of the country in which you maintain your place of residence or from where you access the website, the data can be used by PREVENTICUS in Germany and every other country where PREVENTICUS operates.

3.\u0009We restrict access to the data to those employees and third parties who require access in order to perform services. In order to protect your data, we maintain suitable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural security installations like firewalls, individual passwords along with encryption and authentication technologies; moreover, we undertake all other necessary and reasonable administrative, organizational, technical, person-related and physical measures to protect the data against unauthorized or illegal processing and use, accidental demise, destruction or damage, theft or modification and to secure your integrity. Please note that data transmitted via an open network like the Internet or by e-mail can be accessible to anyone. We are unable to guarantee and insofar bear no responsibility for the confidentiality of communications and information transmitted via such open networks. When transmitting data via open networks, you should consider the fact that your data is potentially accessible to others and, accordingly, can and will be gathered and used by third parties without your permission. Whereas data packets are commonly encrypted, this does not apply to the names of sender and recipient. Even when both sender and recipient are located in the same country, data in networks are regularly channeled uncontrolled through other countries, including those with lower data protection standards than Germany. During transmission, your data and information can get lost or be caught or intercepted by unauthorized persons. We can assume no liability for direct or indirect gaps with respect to the security of data and information during their transfer via the Internet.

4.\u0009PREVENTICUS shall not use the data for marketing purposes, this includes direct marketing via advertising e-mails and selling or renting to third parties, the data transmitted by the users without the agreement of those affected thereby and shall not make said data accessible, unless permitted within the scope of the present data security policy or required by law.

5.\u0009PREVENTICUS shall be allowed to receive, test and archive technical data (including error messages) from terminal devices deployed to the website.

6.\u0009We reserve the right to report data within the scope that we reasonably believe is necessary in order to (i) comply with applicable legal and statutory requirements, court subpoenas or requests from government agencies, (ii) enforce the present Terms of Use including our data security policy and to prosecute any breaches, (iii) to uncover, prevent or otherwise deal with fraud, security gaps or technical problems, (iv) to react to support queries from users or (v) to protect the rights, property or security of PREVENTICUS, its users and the public.

7.\u0009Please note that PREVENTICUS uses encryption software, which may be subject to export controls.

8.\u0009The website may contain links to websites or materials not operated by PREVENTICUS. Such websites are not subject to this data security policy, and PREVENTICUS shall assume no responsibility whatsoever for the content and accuracy of these websites or for the regulations applied thereunto with regards to the processing of personal data and information.

    <string name="info_disclaimer_text" formatted="false">"Clinical trials have demonstrated that the algorithm on which this app is based can detect the difference between irregular cardiac rhythms (e.g. atrial fibrillation) and regular heart rhythms with an accuracy of up to 95%. In other words, for example, in only 5% of all cases did the app mistakenly not detect a cardiac arrhythmia (although present) and/or mistakenly classify a normal cardiac rhythm as a cardiac arrhythmia (although absent). The user of this app is hereby made aware of possible misinterpretations, and thereby releases PREVENTICUS from any liability arising from any misinterpretation.

The findings obtained are exclusively intended for information purposes and under no circumstances do they replace personal diagnostics, consultations, care or treatment by medical or other medically trained personnel.

The app is not designed to be an aid in either decision-making for acute states or for real-time monitoring of vital functions: Neither does this App encroach upon any existing guideline-compliant diagnostic pathways or therapeutic measures.

PREVENTICUS and its executive bodies, executives, employees, vicarious agents, partners, affiliates and licensors assume no responsibility whatsoever for decisions made by you based on the information, such as decisions as to whether or not to consult caregivers or accept treatment by medical or healthcare professionals. You hereby waive all and any claims you have or may have in the future against PREVENTICUS and its executive bodies, executives, employees, vicarious agents, partners, affiliates and licensors and herewith declare to hold the aforementioned harmless from any claims, litigation, costs or for any direct or indirect damages arising in connection with the use of the information. This also applies to lost earnings."</string>

    <string name="info_purpose_text1">"This app is designed to detect evidence indicating the presence of cardiac arrhythmias in out-patient settings under non-acute circumstances. The cardiac arrhythmias covered include bradycardia, tachycardia, absolute atrial fibrillation and the occurrence of extrasystoles. This involves determination of your heart rate data measured on a smartphone camera over a brief period of 1 to 5 minutes. If such evidence is detected, the affected user can store the underlying details. Beyond this, the affected user is recommended to seek more comprehensive medical evaluation from a health care professional. The findings do not constitute a diagnosis in the medical sense, but rather only the suggestion of a potential suspicion.

Medication or drugs affecting the heart rate or pacemakers can potentially falsify the results of the rhythm analysis.

The app can be used for self-testing by any person irrespective of gender, aged 18 years or older. The measurement should be performed at normal room temperature and under normal lighting conditions. The camera must be exclusively applied to healthy skin tissue on the finger. The app should not be used while the terminal device is charging.

The app is intended for use on one of the smart device we have released for use therewith. You can find an updated list at the following link:"</string>
