    <string name="admission_request_faq">"&lt;h2>&lt;b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Inpatient Availment for Elective Cases:&lt;/h2>&lt;/b> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: What is “elective inpatient availment”?&lt;/b> A: Inpatient availment is when the Member is confined in a hospital. It is an elective case when the confinement has been previously ordered or scheduled by the attending physician and the patient did not undergo Emergency care. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Note:&lt;/b> If you require immediate medical attention, even if a scheduled confinement has been ordered, contact your doctor to seek advice if you need to seek Emergency care. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: Is my availment covered by Maxicare?&lt;/b> A: Coverage shall be based on final diagnosis and management of the illness, subject to the evaluation of Maxicare based on your account's coverage and benefit limit. The amount that Maxicare will cover is specified in a Letter of Authorization that is issued by Maxicare. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: How can I check my remaining limit?&lt;/b> A: Your benefit plan coverage is specified either as MBL or ABL. &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;#8226; Maximum Benefit Limit (MBL) is the maximum liability that Maxicare shall cover and assume per covered illness or injury of a Member within the term of the Agreement. &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;#8226; Annual Benefit Limit (ABL) is the maximum liability that Maxicare shall assume for all covered services rendered to a Member, regardless of illness, within the term of the Agreement. &lt;/p> &lt;p> You can verify your remaining benefit limit through the following methods: &lt;/p> &lt;p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 1.) Call our Member Assistance Hotline at these numbers:&lt;br> &lt;b>24/7 CUSTOMER CARE HOTLINE:&lt;/b> (632) 582 – 1900 / 798 – 7777 / 405 – 6294 / 236 – 6294&lt;br> &lt;b>24/7 CUSTOMER CARE:&lt;/b> customercare@maxicare.com.ph &lt;/p> &lt;p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 2.) Inquire with Maxicare representatives located in the nearest Primary Care Centers (PCC) / Helpdesk / Corporate Clinics. For specific locations, please refer to https://www.maxicare.com.ph/contact-us/primary-care-center-and-helpdesk/ &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: How can I secure a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for my availment?&lt;/b> A: You may avail of assisted issuance of the LOA through any of the Maxicare customer service numbers and facilities mentioned earlier such as the Customer Care Hotline, Customer Care, PCC, Helpdesk, or Corporate Clinic. Alternatively, you may also request for an LOA using our self-service electronic facilities such as the Member Gateway, and docHUGO Admission Request. &amp;nbsp &amp;#8226; Member Gateway may be accessed via https://membergateway.maxicare.com.ph/ &amp;nbsp &amp;#8226; Admission Request may be accessed through the docHUGO mobile application &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: What are the guidelines for using docHUGO Admission Request?&lt;/b> A: Complete the required fields and attach scanned copies of the Admission Order and Cardio-Pulmonary (CP) Clearance (if required for surgery), from your doctor(s). &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: After obtaining a duly approved LOA via docHUGO, what do I need to do?&lt;/b> A: Confirm / Obtain your room reservation with the hospital Admission Section. On the admission date, present the LOA together with a valid ID with your picture and signature, Admission Order, and other doctor provided documents, if any. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: Are there any items I need to settle during my availment?&lt;/b> A: You may refer to the Member's Availment Guide handed over to you by our Roving Specialists for reference on non-coverable items/cases, such as excess in limit or miscellaneous items that need to be settled upon discharge. (&lt;b>NOTE:&lt;/b> for patients/hospitals not visited by roving, items are discussed and relayed by Maxicare through a phone call). &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: When shall a Roving Specialist contact me during the confinement?&lt;/b> A: The Maxicare Roving Specialist shall contact and discuss with you your account's benefits and limits within 24 hours upon confinement, from 8AM to 5PM, Mondays to Fridays. You may contact our 24/7 Customer Care Hotline for other related concerns after office hours. For admissions during weekends and holidays, the Roving Specialist may contact you via telephone to assist you accordingly. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: May I be confined with any doctor in any hospital that I choose? &lt;/b> A: Maxicare will cover availments only with its affiliated hospitals and doctors, within your the allowed coverage and benefit limit. Non-affiliated doctors or physicians are those who do not have a signed agreement with Maxicare and availment under said doctors are not covered, unless your enrolled plan has provisions for “Point of Service” benefit in which case non-affiliated doctors may be allowed under special arrangements. Your benefit plan will also dictate some limitations on which hospitals may be accessed, as there are enrolled plans that may exclude specific hospitals. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: Are all medications covered?&lt;/b> A: All medical and surgical management costs that are medically necessary to treat the illness, including prescribed medications only during confinement, can be covered based on your account's benefit coverage and limits. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: What shall I do when I am due for discharge from the hospital?&lt;/b> A: The discharge order will be given by the attending physician and other pertinent documents such as clearance and PhilHealth documents will be processed. Make sure that the appropriate Philhealth claim has been submitted if necessary. Please wait for the the hospital staff to advise you of the final bill, after which you or your representative may proceed to the Billing Section to settle the bill. You will be asked to pay for excess charges, if any, after application of Maxicare and PhilHealth benefits. The hospital will issue a discharge clearance/gatepass upon settlement of the bill. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> NOTE:&lt;/b> The hospital will directly coordinate with Maxicare to ensure that your discharge process is smooth and hassle free. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: What happens if I exceed my limit? What if I cannot settle the excess charges?&lt;/b> A: You will have to settle any excess in coverage upon discharge. Maxicare is no longer liable for any excess beyond your coverage limit. You may take the advice of the Roving Specialist or the Credit Officer from your hospital on options to settle any excess incurred during confinement. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: Why do I need to file for PhilHealth Claim?&lt;/b> A: Filing of PhilHealth claim is requisite to availment of the Philippine Insurance Corporation (PHIC) benefit for hospitalization. The Philhealth benefit is computed by the hospital upon discharge, and deducted from the amount that will be paid by Maxicare and/or the Member. If the Philhealth claim is not filed on or before discharge, the computed amount will be charged to the Member directly by the hospital. When a Maxicare Member is enrolled with added benefit to cover the Philhealth portion (i.e. benefit is ‘PhilHealth covered’), it is optional for the Member to file the PHIC documents/requirements. &lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b> Q: Where can I get the PhilHealth documents?&lt;/b> A: You may inquire at the PhilHealth section of the hospital to obtain the appropriate forms for the processing of your benefit claim. In some instances, your employer’s HR Department may also be able to provide you with the appropriate PHIC forms and requirements. &lt;/p>&lt;br> &lt;h2>&lt;b>Letter of Authority (LOA) Conforme&lt;/h2>&lt;/b> &lt;p> I accept the following terms and conditions of the Letter of Authorization (LOA) that is issued by MAXICARE for approved member availments: &lt;/p> &lt;p> 1. MAXICARE shall not be responsible for the payment of charges/expenses resulting from: &lt;/p> &lt;p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp a. Availment of the following hospital or medical services/treatment/procedures (diagnostic and therapeutic): (i) those rendered by non-affiliated physicians/ specialists or a reliever physician; (ii) those not related to this confinement as determined by the Claims Department of MAXICARE; (iii) those without prior authorization of MAXICARE; (iv) miscellaneous items outside of the Member’s healthcare benefit plan; (v) room accommodation beyond the benefit plan limits; or (vi) co-payment and/or coinsurance defined for the service. &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp b. Failure to file PhilHealth benefit claim to cover all PhilHealth costs incurred during confinement; &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp c. Member’s personal preference to prolong confinement beyond the attending physician's prescribed duration of hospitalization; &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp d. Amount in excess of the Member’s allowable benefit limit in the professional fee of attending doctor/s with whom Member has prior agreement; &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp e. Benefit availment found to be not covered and deemed excluded by the Service Agreement executed by and between MAXICARE and the Member's employer and/or the Member (the Service Agreement), including concealment, even if unintentional or unrelated to the current availment, of relevant medical information, and those in excess of Benefit Limits set out in the agreement, even if conditionally approved by MAXICARE. If at the time of issuance of the LOA, the amount of the Member’s previous availment is not reflected yet, MAXICARE reserves the right to re-adjudicate the Member’s coverage based on the total remaining balance of the benefit limit; and &lt;br> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp f. Other expenses and charges analogous to the foregoing. &lt;/p> &lt;p> MAXICARE shall collect from me the expenses incurred relative to any availment, if upon post verification by MAXICARE, any of the above-mentioned circumstances shall be found present. My request for LOA may likewise be denied outright in the event that the availment is not coverable by MAXICARE. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 2. I confirm that the benefits and coverage requiring the services of a physician shall only be performed by an Affiliated Physician or Specialist referred by MAXICARE. I am aware that there are agreed standard Professional Fees for specific medical services between the Physicians and MAXICARE. Should I undertake a private arrangement with the Physician or Specialist for higher Professional Fee/s, I shall be personally liable to pay the incremental charges resulting from said balance billing. In no case can I demand for reimbursement from MAXICARE for the balance billing charged by the Affiliated Physician or Specialist. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 3. I agree and understand that in the course of providing services to me, MAXICARE shall engage the services of, and/or interact with, other third parties, such as, but not limited to its parent company, affiliated companies, subsidiaries, financial advisors, affiliated third parties or independent/non-affiliated third parties and service providerDb, whether local or foreign (collectively referred to as Representatives). In connection with the foregoing, I hereby irrevocably authorize MAXICARE and its Representatives, being my healthcare maintenance services providerDb, as my attorney-in-fact to: &lt;/p> &lt;p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp a. Obtain, collect, examine, process, store and share my and/or my dependents personal information, including sensitive personal information and privileged information, medical records, or any other information relative to my and my dependents’ hospitalization, consultation, and treatment or any medical advice in connection with the benefit/claim availed under the Service Agreement, as may be deemed necessary by MAXICARE. &lt;/p> &lt;p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp b. Disclose the aforementioned information to my employer, its representatives, agents and brokers, MAXICARE and its Representatives, including the service providerDb which will perform the services contemplated in the agreement, for any legitimate business purpose as MAXICARE may deem appropriate, including but not limited to outsourced processing of MAXICARE transactions, profiling or historical statistical analysis, providing advice or information which MAXICARE and its Representatives believe may be of interest to me, to effectively administer or manage my account, enhance customer services, or to communicate with me for any purpose. &lt;/p> &lt;p> Processing would include both manual and automated handling of personal information and storage and data transfers using physical methods as well as electronic via information and communications systems employed by MAXICARE and its Representatives. I retain the right to be informed, to object, access, complain, and rectify, to request for filtering of certain information, and to the corresponding damages in case of violation of your rights within the corresponding limitations as set forth in the pertinent laws. The authorities herein provided shall be valid and existing during the term of the agreement, including any extensions thereof, and until necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of any claims arising from the said agreement. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 4. For purposes hereof, I hereby warrant that I have been duly authorized by my dependent/s to sign and execute any and all documents and make representations for and in his/their behalf as if the same were personally done by him/them. I understand my rights and obligations pursuant to the Data Privacy Act and its implementing rules and regulations, as the same may be amended. I further agree to hold MAXICARE and its Representatives free and harmless from and against any and all suits or claims, actions, or proceedings, damages, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, which may be filed, charged, or adjudged against MAXICARE or any of its directors, stockholders, officers, employees, agents, or Representatives in connection with or arising from the use, processing and disclosure by MAXICARE or its Representatives of the aforementioned information. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 5. The Membership Terms and Conditions that are maintained and published via MAXICARE website at &lt;b>https://maxicare.ph/member-terms&lt;/b>, and the provisions of the Service Agreement with MAXICARE, as may be amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference.

TELECONSULT Services: The services received from Maxicare’s health counselor are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship. A member should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by the health counselor or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with his primary care physician and other health care professionals as recommended. Anticipated benefits may be expected but no results can be guaranteed or assured. The health counselor, in his sole discretion and professional judgment, may determine that TELECONSULT services are not appropriate for some or all of the member’s treatment needs and, accordingly, may elect not to provide TELECONSULT services to a member. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 2. Rider: Maxicare makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the health advice to be provided by the health counselor. It does not warrant the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, usefulness, adequacy, completeness or suitability of the advice provided. Furthermore, it does not guarantee that a video and/or telephone consultation is the appropriate course of treatment for a member’s particular health care problem. The member hereby agrees to contact his physician immediately should his condition change or symptoms worsen. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 3. Limitation of Liability: Maxicare shall not be liable for any loss, liability, damage or expense arising out of or in connection with the health advice to be provided by the health counselor, unless such loss, liability, damage or expense shall be proven to result directly from the gross and willful misconduct of such person. In no event will Maxicare be liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential damages. Under no circumstances will the liability of Maxicare exceed, in the aggregate, the fees actually paid pursuant to this Agreement. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 4. Potential Risks: It is hereby understood that the following risks are associated with TELECONSULT services: &lt;/p> &lt;p> a. The information provided by members may be insufficient to enable the health counselor to provide appropriate medical or health care advice; &lt;/p> &lt;p> b. There may be delays in evaluation due to failure of the electronic equipment; and &lt;/p> &lt;p> c. The lack of access to all the member’s medical records may result in adverse drug reactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors. &lt;/p> &lt;p> d. There may be symptoms and ailments that may not be completely diagnosed except through actual physical examination or observation of demeanor which may cause misdiagnosis or errors in treatment. &lt;/p> &lt;p> 5.

The extent of the collection, processing and disclosure of information shall be necessary and incidental to the performance of the services contemplated in the agreement. &lt;/p> &lt;p> Furthermore, the member hereby warrants that it understands its rights and obligations pursuant to the Data Privacy Act and its implementing rules and regulations. Consequently, the member shall hold Maxicare free and harmless from and against any and all suits or claims, actions, or proceedings, damages, costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, which may be filed, charged or adjudged against Maxicare or any of its directors, stockholders, officers, employees, agents, or Representatives in connection with or arising from the use, collection, processing, and disclosure by Maxicare or any of its Representatives of the aforementioned information for the purpose of performing the services contemplated in the relevant service agreement. &lt;/p> &lt;p> I have read and fully understood the Terms and Conditions and hereby agree to be governed by the said terms and conditions. &lt;/p> * The Terms and Conditions are subject to change.
