A Garmin device’s “useful life” means the period during which the device (a) has the required technical capabilities to utilize the then-current Live services (including a Live services-compatible operating system) and (b) is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. A Garmin device will be deemed to be out of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been downloaded for such device for a period of 24 months or more. Garmin Live services content is not available for all areas. Garmin may terminate a Live services subscription immediately for violations of the Live services terms of use. Live services subscriptions may not be transferred to another person or another Garmin product, even if the application remains on the smartphone. Garmin Live Services are in part - depending on the service - geographically restricted to the reception and transmission range of the radio transmitters, operated by the respective network operators. They can be affected by atmospheric conditions, topographical conditions, the vehicles location or position as well as obstacles (for example bridges and buildings).Some services are generally not available in every country. The extent and characteristics of the available services differ from country to country. You are personally responsible for the compliance with the laws and regulations of the respective countries.

 "<b>Lifetime Maps. </b>"If you purchase a nüMapsTM Lifetime subscription (sold separately) or if your Garmin product comes bundled with a nüMaps Lifetime or other lifetime map subscription, you will receive Map Data updates when and as such updates are made available on Garmin’s website, during the useful life of one (1) compatible Garmin product or as long as Garmin receives Map Data from HERE, whichever is shorter.A product’s “useful life” means the period during which the product (a) has sufficient memory capacity and other required technical capabilities to utilize current map data and (b) is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. A product will be deemed to be out of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been downloaded for such product for a period of 24 months or more. Unless otherwise stated, the updates you receive under the subscription will be updates to the same geographic area included with your Garmin product when originally purchased. In some instances, your Garmin product might not have sufficient memory remaining for you to load an update to the Map Data, in which case you will need to either (a) select reduced Map Data coverage for your updates, or (b) purchase separately a microSD card or a SD card (if and as applicable to your Garmin product) and load all or a portion of the Map Data coverage for your updates to the card and insert the card into the microSD card or SD card slot contained in your Garmin product. If neither of the measures in (a) or (b) can be used to address your product’s lack of sufficient remaining memory, then Garmin may conclude that the “useful life” of your product has expired. Garmin may terminate your nüMaps Lifetime or other lifetime map subscription at any time if you violate any of the terms of this Agreement or your subscription. Your nüMaps Lifetime subscription or other lifetime map subscription may not be transferred to another person or another Garmin product.

You agree not to reproduce, copy, modify, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or create derivative works of any portion of the Application or the Data, and you may not transfer or distribute it in any form, for any purpose. 

"<b>Term and Termination.</b>" The term of the license for the base, free of charge, Application and Data is limited to twenty-four (24) months. The term will automatically be extended for the lifetime of your mobile telephone if you purchase and activate features of the Application that are not part of the base, free of charge, Application features. The license is attached to the mobile telephone on which you first activate the Application. If you terminate your contract with the mobile telephone provider prior to the end of the license period, the license ends automatically even if you have purchased premium Application features. 

"<b>No Warranties.</b>" The Application and Data are provided to you “as is,” and you agree to use them at your own risk. Garmin and its licensors (and their licensors and suppliers) make no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, arising by law or otherwise, including but not limited to, content, quality, accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, usefulness, use or results to be obtained from the Application or Data, or that the Application and Data will be uninterrupted or error-free. The Data may contain inaccurate or incomplete information due to the passage of time, changing circumstances, sources used and the nature of collecting comprehensive geographic data, any of which may lead to incorrect results. 

"<b>Disclaimer of Liability.</b>" GARMIN AND ITS LICENSORS (INCLUDING THEIR LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU: IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND OR ACTION, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF THE CLAIM, DEMAND OR ACTION ALLEGING ANY LOSS, INJURY OR DAMAGES, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OR POSSESSION OF THE APPLICATION OR THE DATA; OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, CONTRACTS OR SAVINGS, OR ANY OTHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION OR DATA, ANY DEFECT IN THE APPLICATION OR DATA, OR THE BREACH OF THESE TERMS OR CONDITIONS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR BASED ON A WARRANTY, EVEN IF GARMIN OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. GARMIN’S AND ITS LICENSORS’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OR THE DATA SHALL NOT EXCEED U.S $1.00. Some countries do not allow certain liability exclusions or damages limitations, so to that extent the above may not apply to you. 

"<b>Export Control.</b>" You agree not to export from anywhere any part of the Data provided to you except in compliance with all licenses and approvals required under applicable export laws, rules and regulations. 

"<b>Indemnity.</b>" You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Garmin and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising out of or in connection with any use or possession by you of the Application or Data. 

"<b>Data collection, Storage and Use.</b>" Garmin may collect, store and use your personal data in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations to the extent necessary for the creation or modification of your account and to manage the billing services application to your account (if applicable). The location of your mobile telephone is collected and processed on an anonymous basis in order to provide you with certain location-based Live Services, such as Weather Live, if and when you use such Live Services. 

"<b>Entire Agreement.</b> These terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between Garmin (and its licensors, including their licensors and suppliers) and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes in their entirety any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between us with respect to such subject matter.</string>
