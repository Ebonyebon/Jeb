    <string name="help_color10">Tap and hold on any sample and you will get options for deleting samples you no longer need.</string>
    <string name="help_color11">Tracing Images:</string>
    <string name="help_color12">"Load a Tracing Image as a guide while you paint. ArtRage can be set to pick colors from it automatically with each stroke.

Tracing Images can be loaded from your Photo gallery."</string>
    <string name="help_color13">"The preview at the top shows you the image you have loaded.

The Eye button indicates if the image is visible. If it is, you will see it overlaid on the canvas. Tap it to show or hide the image.

The menu button gives you options for loading and scaling the image, and for automatic color sampling.

The Opacity slider controls how strongly the image is overlaid on your canvas."</string>
    <string name="help_color14">Reference Images:</string>
    <string name="help_color15">Reference Images are photos loaded from your Photo gallery and pinned to the canvas while you work as a guide.</string>
    <string name="help_color16">"Tap 'New' to load a new Reference from your Photo gallery.

The Eye button is used to show or hide the Reference and the Menu button provides options for that Reference.

Loaded references are 'pinned' to the canvas."</string>
    <string name="help_color17">"A Reference that is pinned to the canvas can be moved and scaled using two fingers, just like the canvas. Two fingers can also be used to rotate the image.

Tapping and dragging with one finger in a reference chooses a color from it for your current paint."</string>
    <string name="help_color18">Layers are transparent sheets that sit in a stack on your canvas. Painting on a layer means that you can paint without damaging the work you have done on other layers.</string>
    <string name="help_color19">"Each layer has a preview showing its contents, and an Eye button to show or hide it on the canvas.

The Circular button indicates how opaque the Layer is, tap and drag up and down to change this value."</string>
    <string name="help_color2">The Color Picker allows you to select the current Paint Color and store Color Samples for quick access later.</string>
    <string name="help_color20">"Add a new Layer with the New button. You can then tap that Layer to select it, and any paint you apply to the canvas is applied to that Layer.Tap and drag on the arrow box on the left of the preview to move the layer up and down in the list.

Because each Layer is its own 'sheet', the paint that you apply will not blend with paint from any other Layer, so you can use Layers to simulate paint drying."</string>
    <string name="help_color21">"Transform individual layers, or transform all layers at once.

Layer Transform allows individual layers, or the entire painting, to be moved, flipped, scaled and rotated. It includes locks for each variable to allow perfect control.

The Transform Layer option can be found in the Layers menu, under the menu options for each layer."</string>
    <string name="help_color22">"You can turn on Transform Locks in the settings menu. The different Transform Locks make it easier to edit your painting by locking rotation, scale, position on screen, canvas or paint.

Active Transform Locks show up as icons along the top of the screen and can be turned off again by tapping the icon."</string>

    <string name="help_color3">The thin arc shows the basic color you are picking.</string>

    <string name="help_color5a">"The metallic arc selects how shiny the paint is.

The pod shows the current color."</string>
    <string name="help_color6">This shows the current color.</string>
    <string name="help_color7">Using the Color Picker:</string>
    <string name="help_color8">"Color selection works in two stages: First you pick a basic color (the 'Hue') such as Red or Blue using the thin color arc on the outside of the picker.

Once you have picked a Hue, you set how light or dark, and how vibrant or grey the final color should be by dragging in the larger arc of the picker.

Think of it as if you are mixing colors - Picking a basic hue and blending in white and black to get the final result.

The color Pod at the bottom right shows the actual color you will be painting with. Tap it to show or hide the picker."</string>
    <string name="help_color8a">If you have a tracing image loaded, color will be selected automatically and the pod will show a trace icon.</string>
    <string name="help_color9">Color Samples are stored colors you can access later. Tap Add Sample to store the current color as a sample, tap a sample to make it the current color.</string>
    <string name="help_files1">The Gallery:</string>
    <string name="help_files10">"Do not use 'Share' to export an image then 'Import' to bring it back in for more work - Always use the Saved Painting when you want to continue working on an image."</string>
    <string name="help_files11">Creating New Paintings:</string>
    <string name="help_files12">When you tap New Painting you are presented with a set of options that allow you to define how the canvas will look and what kind of texture it has.</string>
    <string name="help_files13">"Enter the Name of your painting by tapping the Name entry box.

Tap the Size indicator to set its size. The icon to the right is used to rotate the canvas 90 degrees if you want to adjust its orientation."</string>
    <string name="help_files14">This section controls the look of the canvas. Tap the Presets button for a list of predefined canvas types.</string>
    <string name="help_files15">Tap the Grains button to choose a canvas grain from a list.</string>
    <string name="help_files16">Tap the Color button to set the basic color of the canvas (the default is slightly off-white).</string>
    <string name="help_files17">The Roughness slider controls how rough the Grain is.</string>
    <string name="help_files18">The Metallic slider controls how shiny the canvas is.</string>
    <string name="help_files19">The Reset button resets all canvas properties to default in case you need to clear everything.</string>
    <string name="help_files2">All of your Paintings are stored in the Gallery. When you return here from the canvas your current Painting is saved. The Gallery lets you view, adjust, and load your paintings for additional work.</string>
    <string name="help_files20">Click OK to create your new Painting, or Cancel to return to the Gallery.</string>
    <string name="help_files21">"On the right hand side of the New Painting screen is a preview of your canvas, showing how a paint stroke will look when applied to it.

Use the preview to check how the Grain and Roughness values affect the look of paint - Some tools such as Pastel and dry Oil react to the texture of the canvas in different ways."</string>
    <string name="help_files22">Scripting:</string>
    <string name="help_files22a">Script Recording</string>
    <string name="help_files23">Script Recording allows you to record your paint strokes in a file that can be exported and played back in a desktop version of ArtRage. This allows you to recreate the painting process for screen recording or demos. Certain desktop editions (such as ArtRage 5) allow you to change the Canvas Size when you start script playback, which allows you to increase the final size of the painting larger than the Android app can support.</string>
    <string name="help_files23a">You can turn on recording in the New Painting screen when you start a new painting by selecting the Record Script option.</string>
    <string name="help_files24">Script Exporting</string>
    <string name="help_files25">"After saving a painting with recording active you can export its Script from the Gallery using its file sharing options. In the Gallery choose 'Share' to export the script file to email or a file sharing app, or choose Export to create a copy of the script file in the ArtRage/Scripts folder on your device."</string>
    <string name="help_files26">Scripts can be exported multiple times, so you can continue painting and export updated scripts later. Scripts continue to record automatically if you open the original painting file in a desktop edition that supports recording.</string>
    <string name="help_files2a">There are three buttons in the Gallery Toolbar: Tap New Painting to add a new painting to your gallery. Tap Import to load an image from another application or from the camera to use as a painting. Tap the System button (three dots) for gallery options.</string>
    <string name="help_files2b">To add a new painting tap the + button on the Gallery toolbar.</string>
    <string name="help_files3">"When you tap a painting, its information panel appears. Tap the preview to open the painting to continue work on it.

The buttons underneath are:

Rotate Left, Rotate Right - Tap to rotate the canvas 90 degrees in the indicated direction.

Share - Tap to share a copy of your painting.

Duplicate - Tap to create a new copy of the painting in the gallery.

Delete - Tap to delete the painting."</string>
    <string name="help_files7">Import and Export:</string>
    <string name="help_files8">"ArtRage Paintings are not just image files like photos, they contain lots of extra information about the paint such as how wet it is and how thick it is. This means that your Painting files won’t be understood by normal Image readers such as Photo galleries.

Share allows you to share a copy of a Painting in a format that can be understood by another application, such as a PNG or JPEG image file.

Import allows you to bring an existing non-ArtRage image in to a canvas for painting. This prepares a copy of the original and adds the information ArtRage needs to allow the paint to work. This copy can be used like a standard Painting."</string>

    <string name="help_touch_1">What is Touch Pressure?</string>
    <string name="help_touch_1a">Touch Pressure lets you use your finger or rubber tipped stylus to draw more realistically. Once you have a custom preset, you will be able to use a finger to draw with different amounts of pressure in ArtRage. The changing size of your finger or stylus tip on the screen will change the pressure of your stroke.</string>
    <string name="help_touch_1b">"The changing size of your finger or stylus tip on the screen will change the size of the line you are drawing.

ArtRage uses the different levels of surface area sensitivity (the size of your touch) that your device screen can detect and converts this into pressure when you are painting in ArtRage.

Performance will vary widely across different devices and for different users, so you need to create a custom preset before you can use touch pressure. You can save multiple presets for different users, tools, and effects."</string>
    <string name="help_touch_2">Why do you need to create a preset to use touch pressure?</string>
    <string name="help_touch_2a">"You have to create a preset to show ArtRage how to interpret your range of touches on the screen. If we created a default preset, it would not work for most people.

Every device is different, different fingers have different shapes and people use their hands differently. You may also want different sensitivity options for different tools."</string>
    <string name="help_touch_3">How do I create a new preset?</string>
    <string name="help_touch_3a">"To create a preset, go to the 'Create New Preset' screen from Settings. Use one finger (or stylus) to draw lines that vary from small to large. You want to get as small as possible and as large as possible. This teaches ArtRage what range of touch to use.

Creating a preset can be tricky the first time you try, because the way you change your finger size on the screen is different for everybody. It is much easier to draw in ArtRage than it is to create a new preset, so once you have set it up, you will find painting much more fun.

You do not need to press harder to make bigger lines, but you do need to create a larger area of touch. Sometimes pressing harder is the easiest way to do this, but sometimes it is easier to place your finger differently so that it covers a large area."</string>
    <string name="help_touch_3b">"If you are having trouble getting enough variation, try using just a finger tip and then most of your finger.

When you first start drawing, the line may be pale grey and will not change size properly. This shows it does not have enough different size information yet."</string>
    <string name="help_touch_3c">You will know it is working when the line turns dark and starts showing different sizes. It may not look very smooth, but this is okay. It will look smoother when you are actually painting.</string>
    <string name="help_touch_4">Devices</string>
    <string name="help_touch_4a">"Some screens are more sensitive than others. Some will be very easy to use touch pressure with because they have a lot of levels (how many different sizes it will detect). Some devices will not work very well at all.

Most devices do not allow a very wide range of pressure when using touch. This means that slow strokes may look wobbly, or it may be difficult to create a preset with a wide pressure range."</string>
    <string name="help_touch_5">Styluses</string>
    <string name="help_touch_5a">You can use touch pressure as well as your stylus, but if your device comes with a pressure sensitive stylus, then the stylus will always work better as it allows a much wider range of sensitivity than touch input.</string>
    <string name="help_touch_6">How does pressure affect your painting?</string>
    <string name="help_touch_6a">"The different tools in ArtRage respond to pressure differently, just like in real life. Some tools will change the size of the stroke with a larger amount of pressure, and others will lay down more color but will not change size. For example, the Oil Brush and Ink Pen will change size, so different pressure will let you create different size dots, or draw lines that get wider and narrower. The Pastel, Pencil and Airbrush will not change size but will get darker or lighter.

You can adjust 'Pressure' in the tool settings to change the default pressure for each tool and the Touch Pressure will let you vary above and below the default Pressure."</string>

If you think your device supports touch pressure, try again using more variation in the size of your touches."</string>
    <string name="touch_calibration_explanation_core">"Draw on the canvas below to make as many different size strokes as possible without lifting your finger. The varying strokes will help ArtRage to calibrate a preset for you. Touch the screen with more or less of your finger (or stylus) to change the size of the stroke.

Continue drawing on the screen until the progress bar is full and the 'calculating' message appears."</string>
    <string name="touch_calibration_explanation_popup">Touch Pressure allows you to mimic pressure sensitivity on your screen using your finger or a non-pressure sensitive stylus. It does this by tracking the size of your touch on screen and converting this to pressure. This feature will very perform differently on different devices, so you will need to calibrate your device and create a preset that works for you.</string>
    <string name="touch_calibration_explanation_popup_2">Create a preset to start using Touch Pressure. To create a preset, you need to teach ArtRage how to respond to different size touches on your device’s screen. You will do this by drawing lines on the screen that change in size as you draw, until ArtRage can reliably recognise small and large touches from your finger or stylus. You can create multiple presets with different touch profiles.</string>
    <string name="touch_info_popup_title">Getting Started</string>
    <string name="touch_pressure_explanation_message">"Touch Pressure lets you use your finger or rubber tipped stylus to draw more realistically. The changing size of your finger or stylus tip will change the size of the line you are drawing.

Performance will vary widely across different devices and for different users, so you need to create a custom preset before you can use touch pressure. You can save multiple presets for different users, tools, and effects.

Most devices do not allow a wide range of pressure when using touch. This means that slow strokes may look wobbly.

If your device comes with a pressure sensitive stylus, the stylus will work better, but you can still use touch pressure."</string>
