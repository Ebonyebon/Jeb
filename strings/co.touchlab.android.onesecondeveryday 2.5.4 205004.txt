    <string name="about_cesar">"For over 4 years, I've been recording 1 second every day, so I'll never forget another day ever again. This project has had such a profoundly positive impact on my life, that I've passionately developed an App that will make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do this too.

You can check out the first year of this lifelong project here:
https://vimeo.com/37792362

The second year was made with this App:
https://vimeo.com/65154352

You can check out my TED talk about this project here:

To learn more about how this App came about and my ethos behind the project, check out the Kickstarter page that made it all possible thanks to the generosity of 11,281 wonderful backers:

    <string name="answer_backup">1SE automatically backs up your data on Google Drive. When you get a new phone, just login to the same Google Drive account and your saved snippets will appear. You will have to re-compile your seconds, as the compilations are not stored in the cloud.</string>
    <string name="answer_backup_where">"The data is in a hidden folder, so that it doesn't get mixed up with your other files or accidentally deleted. Google added this feature for apps to backup data. Check it out: https://developers.google.com/drive/appdata"</string>

    <string name="answer_save">Yes - 1SE saves using the Google Drive API. Drive helps us both manage the files locally and automatically sync to a hidden folder on your Drive account.</string>
    <string name="answer_semantics">"This was a deliberate choice we knew we'd end up explaining often. Everyday means “routine”, “ordinary”, “commonplace”… while every day means “daily”… and we intentionally want it to mean both. This is a lifelong project after all. At least for us."</string>
