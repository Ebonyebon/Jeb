    <string name="large_text">"Material is the metaphor.

 A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet  technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.
 Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The  use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the  flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical  world, without breaking the rules of physics.
 The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move,  interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows  seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.

 Bold, graphic, intentional.

 The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color,  and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the  eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge  imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic  interface that immerse the user in the experience.
 An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides  waypoints for the user.

 Motion provides meaning.

 Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are  inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.
 All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without  breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.
 Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity.  Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.

 3D world.

 The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z  dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the  positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single  position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.
 On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is  emulated by manipulating the y-axis.

 Light and shadow.

 Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create  directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.
 Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android  development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at  various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the  y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.

 Resting elevation.

 All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation  that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting  elevation as soon as possible.

 Component elevations.

 The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation  does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).
 Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth  of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).

 Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.

 Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response  to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation  changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.
 Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative  to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent  across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have  the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.
 Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting  elevation.

 Avoiding elevation interference.

 Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between  their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass  through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways,  whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.
 On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference.  For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a  user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.
 On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference.  For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere  when a user tries to pick up one of cards.

    <string name="oversized_luggage_policy_text">"Vehicles have limited space. Items considered excessive are subject to a small fee. The fee is dependent on the item(s) in question and may vary by location. Athletic equipment (e.g. bikes, surfboards, skis, golf clubs, etc.), non-ADA motorized scooters, and pet carriers will be subject to additional fees. Because of variations in fleets from city to city, not all items are permitted in all cities and vehicles. Large boxes may also incur an additional fee. Boxes include bicycle boxes, travel trunks, and musical cases for larger instruments. Shipping boxes are also considered oversized due to the weight they can hold, not because of their dimensions. Depending on the city, and the city's vehicle type, items like these may require an Exclusive reservation. 

Large trunks, athletic equipment and oversized luggage may require Exclusive van service."</string>
    <string name="oversized_luggage_policy_text_ARN">"For each passenger, 1 checked bag and 1 carry-on item are allowed. Choose the number of bags you are bringing under Passenger information in your booking. You do not need to include your carry-on bag. 

In case of excess luggage like sports equipment, strollers, bikes and large boxes a note has to be made when making your reservation under “Passenger information - special notes”, in order for us to make room for your luggage. Excess luggage include checked bags that are more than 23 kg in weight and 250 cm if you combine the length, height and width all together. There will be no extra fees for excess luggage. 

If you want to travel with a bike, you will need to book and exclusive ride. You also have to keep you bike in a cover to get it into the car. 

When travelling with skis for a shared ride, a maximum of 3 pairs of skis per booking can be taken into the car. Skis for children does not need to be included in these 3 pairs. If you wish to bring more than 3 pairs of skis or larger ski packages, you will need to book an exclusive ride. Please note that you will have to make a note in your booking in the field Passenger information - specific information to ensure space in the car. 

If we believe that the amount of luggage will exceed what is possible for your shared ride, we might ask you to change your booking to an exclusive ride to be able to bring your luggage. If you do not give us the right information about the amount of luggage and excess luggage, we can not guarantee that we can bring it when picking you up."</string>
    <string name="oversized_luggage_policy_text_Paris">Customers are authorized to transport up to 2 classic bags in addition to their carry-on baggage. The size of baggage must not exceed the following dimensions: 80 *60*25 cm with a maximum weight of 20 kg. Any additional luggage must be mentioned at the time of the reservation and shall be charged EUR 5 each, including all taxes. Customers with oversized luggage shall be transported via private service. In order to ensure Customers’ safety, luggage must be placed in the areas reserved for this purpose; they cannot be transported aboard the vehicle on seats or in areas intended to enable people to move around inside the vehicle. The Customer is fully responsible for the content of their luggage. Save for fault by the Carrier, the latter cannot be held liable for the loss, theft or damage, at the time of loading, transfer or unloading, of the Customer’s luggage, unless these events or incidents are attributable to the Carrier. Any object found in a vehicle shall be left at SuperShuttle’s head office, or if so decided by the latter, at the lost and found department closest to its head office, where the Customer will be able to come pick it up within 1 year from the relevant transfer date.</string>
