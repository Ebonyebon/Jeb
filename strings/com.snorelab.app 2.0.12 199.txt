Air flowing through your mouth dries out your mouth tissues and vibrates your soft palate which is one of the most common causes of snoring. If you wake up in the morning with a dry or sticky mouth, it is likely that you were mouth breathing.

A humidifer can help combat this by reducing nasal congestion and also replenishing moisture in your mouth.
