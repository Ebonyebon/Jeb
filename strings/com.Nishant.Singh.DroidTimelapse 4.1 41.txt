"<u><b>Frequently Answered Questions:</b></u>"

"<i>Q: What settings should I use for my timelapse?</i>"
A: For fast moving objects use frame interval 0.1 to 3 seconds. Clouds look good in 3 to 8 seconds interval. For flower/plant growth 30 seconds to 10 minutes. All other activities can be calculated similarly based on their speed as compared to these events.

"<i>Q: Is there any limit in video duration in free version?</i>"
A: No, there is no any limit at all. The free version lets you record as long as you like, in the highest quality and that too without any ads. But if you like the app, buying the pro version is great way to thank and support us. Not to mention, all the features that come along with the pro version will help you make even better timelapse videos.

"<i>Q: When does exposure lock and white balance lock work?</i>"
A: If you have them enabled, as soon as recording starts they are locked and released when recording is finished. It helps to prevent flicker due to changing lighting condition.

"<i>Q: I am unable to write on SD card in Android 4.4+?</i>"
A: Since Android 4.4 apps do not have permission to write to a SD card for security reasons.

"<i>Q: Does it take time for the video to be rendered after stopping the recording?</i>"
A: No, you can view the video almost instantaneously without any delay.

"<i>Q: Where are the photos stored, do they take my storage space?</i>"
A: The app does not store photos. It records to high quality compressed video and thus saves a lot of space and time. The default location is DCIM/Framelapse. All videos are displayed in your gallery as-well.

"<i>Q: Sometimes the app stops recording?</i>"
A: This app requires to be in the foreground for performance and privacy concerns. So if any other apps takes control, the recording will be stopped. If your device has block all notifications mode, it can be helpful. Airplane mode can also be helpful.

"<i>Q: Can I record in background?</i>"
A: In the pro version you can turn off the screen to save battery. But this app requires to be in the foreground for performance and most importantly, privacy concerns.

"<i>Q: The app does not work properly after Android update?</i>"
A: Reset or reinstall app if you have any issues after update.

"<i>Q: The app records only 2 frames and stops?</i>"
A: On some low end devices with less ram the app might not work properply due to performance issues.

"<i>Q: Using custom lockscreen app stops recording?</i>"
A: Please do not use custom lockscreens if you want to turn off screen while recording. They stop the app, so disable them before using it if you need the screen off feature.

"<i>Q: Can I turn screen on/off manually using power button any time without stopping the recording?</i>"
A: Yes, but make sure not to shake the device to prevent videos from being shaky. We suggest waiting for auto screen timeout to turn off screen for better videos without any shake.

"<i>Q: How can I ensure no one can access my device while recording for long periods?</i>"
A: Enable secure lock (pattern, key, etc) in system settings. Once the screen is turned off the device will be locked and only Framelapse will be accessible unless you enter the code/pattern. This prevents device misuse.

"<i>Q: Can I remove free version of the app after installing pro version?</i>"
A: Yes, both versions work independentaly. So you can remove the free version if you want to, after installing framelapse pro.

"<i>Q: If I buy the app can I install it on my device and tablet both?</i>"
A: Yes, all purchases are linked to your account. So as long as you are using the same account you can install on multiple devices of yours, any number of times you like.

"<i>Q: I have a new question?</i>"
A: Email us with your query. We will reply as soon as possible."</string>

"<u><b>Framelapse Application Guide</b></u>"

Timelapse photography is a technique where the frequency at which frames are captured is much lower than that used to play the sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. This app provides you a simple, neat and efficient UI to make timelapse videos effortlessly. Have fun!

"<i><b>App Features Explained:</b></i>"

"<b>Frame Interval:</b>" The time interval between each captured frame. Range –> 0.1 second to 24 hours. It is the most important value for your timelapse recording.

"<b>Video Duration:</b>" The required length (or duration) of the output video. Recording is automatically stopped when it is reached unless it is set to infinite. It is also shown in the centre while recorded length progresses from fraction of seconds (0.xx) to required value. Do not confuse it with the recording duration which can be very long in case of timelapse videos.

"<b>Custom values:</b>" The free version of the app gives predefined values for various functions. In the pro version custom implies user can choose their own values from a much larger range. HH:MM:SS means Hours:Minutes:Seconds, and in frame interval you can also choose fraction (.x) of seconds (by pressing the menu icon on top right) for very small intervals like 0.1 – 0.9 seconds.

"<b>Video Resolution:</b>" The height and width of the output recording video. Higher the resolution better the quality, but more the storage size.

"<b>Self Timer:</b>" The initial delay after which the recording starts. Useful for stabilising the device or preparing the scene.

"<b>Camera options:</b>" Autofocus, white balance settings, colour effects and exposure compensation. (*if supported)

"<b>Exposure Lock:</b>" If it is switched on exposure is locked when recording starts to prevent flicker from lighting conditions. Very useful in timelapse.

"<b>White Balance Lock:</b>" It locks the white balance when recording starts to prevent changing white balance. Again very useful in timelapse.

"<b>Wizard:</b>" If you are not sure of the frame interval but know the recording duration and video duration expected, this will calculate it for you.

"<b>Sleep Mode:</b>" Using it allows the device to turn off screen when it times out and keep recording in the background. Please be careful, it still requires that no other app disturbs it. Read FAQ if you have any questions.

"<b>Ignore Notifications:</b>" Continue recording even if a notification occurs.

"<b>Shutter Sound:</b>" For frame interval above 1 second, shutter sound can be played. Please note start and stop sound will always play unless on mute.

"<b>Switch Camera:</b>" If your device has multiple cameras you can use this to switch between them. Also note each camera has its own values for timelapse settins, but the main app settins will remain common to all cameras.

"<b>High Performance:</b>" Unless you are having any issues let it remain on. It helps the app work a little faster.

"<b>Notification Light:</b>" If your device has front coloured LED lights, it will use it when screen is off to display recording is taking place.

"<b>Torch:</b>" If flash LED is available it will be turned on.

"<b>Show Information:</b>" You can view all chosen values for timelapse video on the top right section of the app.

"<b>Storage Directory:</b>" Select the path where to store videos made by this app. Please note that since Android 4.4+ apps do not have permission to write to an external SD card.

"<b>Video Frame Rate:</b>" The playback speed of the output video. 30 fps is optimal and results in fluid videos. The feature might not work on all devices properly so using default value is recommended.

"<b>Zoom:</b>" If device supports zoom multi touch preview to open zoom menu. Slide the bar to change zoom level.

"<b>Community:</b>" For all framelapse users to share and showcase their videos please join the communities.

"<b>Reset:</b>" This will reset the app like a fresh install.
