GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

SONY may also take any legal and technical remedies to prevent violation of and/or to enforce this EULA, including, but not limited to, immediate termination of your use of the SOFTWARE, if SONY believes in its sole discretion that you are violating or intend to violate this EULA. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies SONY may have at law, in equity or under contract.

If you do not agree to the amendment, you should promptly contact SONY for instructions. Your continued use of the SOFTWARE after the effective date of any such notice shall be deemed your agreement to be bound by such amendment.
