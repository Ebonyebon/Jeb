b. This Agreement confers no title or ownership and is not a sale of any rights in the Software. Third-party suppliers are intended beneficiaries under this Agreement and independently may protect their rights in the Software in the event of any infringement. All rights not expressly granted to You are reserved solely to HP or its suppliers. Nothing herein should be construed as granting You, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, a license relating to Software other than as expressly stated above in this section 2. 

c. Unless otherwise permitted by HP, You (a) may only make copies or adaptations of the Software for archival purposes or when copying or adaptation is an essential step in the authorized Use of the Software on a backup device, provided that copies and adaptations are used in no other manner and provided further that the Use on the backup device is discontinued when the original or replacement device becomes operable, and (b) may not copy the Software onto or otherwise Use or make it available on, to, or through any public or external distributed network.

Nothing in this Agreement grants You any right to purchase or receive Software updates, upgrades, or support, and HP is under no obligation to make such support available to you. Updates, upgrades, enhancements, or other Support may only be available under separate HP support agreements. You may contact HP to learn more about any support offerings HP may make available. HP reserves the right to require additional licenses and fees for Software upgrades or other enhancements, or for Use of the Software on upgraded devices.

i. You will not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, decompile, or make derivative works of the Software. Where You have other rights mandated under statute, You will provide HP with reasonably detailed information regarding any intended modifications, reverse engineering, disassembly, decryption, or decompilation and the purposes therefore. 

j. Extending the Use of Software to any person or entity other than You as a function of providing services, (i.e.; making the Software available through a commercial timesharing or service bureau) must be authorized in writing by HP prior to such Use and may require additional licenses and fees.

3. WARRANTY 

(i) IF SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT A LICENSE FEE, THE FOLLOWING AS-IS WARRANTY STATEMENT APPLIES TO THE SOFTWARE: 

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HP AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL INDEMNITIES, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK OF VIRUSES. HP does not warrant that the operation of Software will be uninterrupted or error free or that the Software will meet Your requirements. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to You in its entirety.

(ii) IF SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR A LICENSE FEE, THE FOLLOWING LIMITED WARRANTY APPLIES TO THE SOFTWARE: 

a. HP Branded Software will materially conform to its Specifications. If a warranty period is not specified for HP Branded Software, the warranty period will be ninety (90) days from the delivery date, or the date of installation if installed by HP. If You schedule or delay installation by HP more than thirty (30) days after delivery, the warranty period begins on the 31st day after delivery. This limited warranty is subject to the terms, limitations, and exclusions contained in the limited warranty statement provide for Software in the country where the Software is located when the warranty claim is made. 

b. HP warrants that any physical media containing HP Branded Software will be shipped free of viruses. 

c. HP does not warrant that the operation of Software will be uninterrupted or error free, or that Software will operate in hardware and Software combinations other than as expressly required by HP in the Specifications or that Software will meet requirements specified by You. 

d. HP is not obligated to provide warranty services or support for any claims resulting from: 

1. improper site preparation, or site or environmental conditions that do not conform to HP’s site specifications; 

2. Your non-compliance with Specifications; 

3. improper or inadequate maintenance or calibration; 

4. Your or third-party media, software, interfacing, supplies, or other products; 

5. modifications not performed or authorized by HP; 

6. virus, infection, worm or similar malicious code not introduced by HP; or 

7. abuse, negligence, accident, loss or damage in transit, fire or water damage, electrical disturbances, transportation by You, or other causes beyond HP’s control. 

e. HP provides third-party products, software, and services that are not HP Branded AS IS without warranties of any kind, although the original manufacturers or third party suppliers of such products, software and services may provide their own warranties. 

f. If notified of a valid warranty claim during the warranty period, HP will, at its option, correct the warranty defect for HP Branded Software, or replace such Software. If HP is unable, within a reasonable time, to complete the correction, or replace such Software, You will be entitled to a refund of the purchase price paid upon prompt return of such Software to HP. You will pay expenses for return of such Software to HP. HP will pay expenses for shipment of repaired or replacement Software to You. This section 3.(ii) f states HP's entire liability for warranty claims. 

g. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY WARRANTED IN SECTION 3.(ii) a and b ABOVE, HP AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK OF VIRUSES. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to You in its entirety. 

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT FOR SOFTWARE PROVIDED FOR A LICENSE FEE: 

a. In the event Software was provided to You for a License Fee, HP will defend or settle any claim against You alleging that HP Branded Software products provided under this Agreement infringes intellectual property rights in the country where they were sold, if You: 

1. promptly notify HP of the claim in writing; 

2. cooperate with HP in the defense of the claim; and 

3. grant HP sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim. 

HP will pay infringement claim defense costs, HP–negotiated settlement amounts, and court-awarded damages. 

b. If such a claim appears likely, then HP may modify the HP Branded Software products, procure any necessary license, or replace the affected item with one that is at least functionally equivalent. If HP determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available, then HP will issue You a refund equal to the purchase price paid for the affected item if within one year of delivery, or Your net book value thereafter. 

c. HP has no obligation for any claim of infringement arising from: 

1. HP’s compliance with Your or third party designs, specifications, instructions, or technical information; 

2. modifications made by You or a third party; 

3. Your non-compliance with the Specifications or the documentation described in section 2. a above; or 

4. Your use with products, software, or services that are not HP Branded. 

d. This section 4 states HP's entire liability for claims of intellectual property infringement for Software provided for a license fee. 

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL HP OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, DOWNTIME COSTS, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS, LOSS, DISCLOSURE, UNAVAILABILITY OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA, SOFTWARE RESTORATION, OR LOSS OF PRIVACY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF HP OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. 

6. TERMINATION 

This Agreement is effective unless terminated or rejected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will also terminate upon conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or if You fail to comply with any term or condition hereof. Immediately upon termination You will destroy the Software and all copies of the Software or return them to HP. You may retain one copy of the Software subsequent to termination solely for archival purposes only. At HP’s request, You will certify in writing to HP that You have complied with these requirements. Sections 3.(i), 3.(ii) g, 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement. 

7. GENERAL 

a. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer (Assign) all or any part of this Agreement without prior written consent from HP, payment to HP of any applicable fees, and compliance with HP's Software license transfer policies and any applicable third party license terms. Any such attempted Assignment will be null and void. Where an authorized Assignment occurs in accordance with this section, Your rights under this Agreement will terminate, and You will immediately deliver the Software and all copies to the Assignee. The Assignee must agree in writing to the terms of this Agreement, and the transferee thereafter will be considered You for purposes of this Agreement. You may transfer firmware only upon transfer of the associated hardware. 

b.

HP may suspend performance if You are in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. 

d. You agree that HP may audit Your compliance with this Agreement. Any such audit would be at HP’s expense, require reasonable notice, and would be performed during normal business hours. If an audit reveals underpayments then You will immediately pay HP such underpayments together with the costs reasonably incurred by HP in connection with the audit and seeking compliance with this section. 

e. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding rules as to choice and conflict of law. You and HP agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement. 

f. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Agreement is the entire agreement between HP and You regarding Your Use of the Software, and supersedes and replaces any previous communications, representations, or agreements, or Your additional or inconsistent terms, whether oral or written. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable the remainder of the Agreement will remain enforceable and unaffected thereby. 

g. HP’s failure to exercise or delay in exercising any of its rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of those rights.

For the purposes of this definition, submitted means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as Not a Contribution.

Contributor shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a NOTICE text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
