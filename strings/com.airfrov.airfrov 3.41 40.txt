 7. Referral code and credit system

 Any members registered with AIRFROV can refer a friend or family member to join with a referral code and will be rewarded with AIRFROV credit that is redeemable to offset the cost upon the next transaction using the Site. Only a maximum of $5 offset is possible per $20 purchase. Hence for a $100 purchase on airfrov, a maximum of $25 AIRFROV credit can be used.

 At no scenario can this credit be ever exchange, sold in exchange of cash or other equivalent unit of currency. The members are allowed to publicize the referral code using various medium such as Facebook, Twitter and other social network but is only limited to personal usage and never for commercial usage.

 

 8. Currency Conversion, Refund and Payment 

 AIRFROV default payment gateway and system will be through Braintree and AIRFROV will not be liable for any loss of conversion in payout due to the rate of currency conversion and any fees charge based on the payment partner, such as PayPal, Braintree, Credit Cards, GIRO Bank Transfer, TT or any other payment method employed.

 When a Traveller offers and a Requester accepts by “Deposit”, then the Requester will be prompted to make the deposit to AIRFROV. The Traveller is entitled to free 10 cancellations a month and is liable for any refund charges (S$1.0) incurred due to cancellation at this stage onwards, if there is no payment account tied to the traveller, the available credit from the Traveller’s accrued credit from the referral code will be used for deduction. 

 The maximum return date by the traveller cannot be more than 90days from the offered date.

 If the Traveller has confirmed delivery and if there’s no dispute, AIRFROV will transfer the reimbursement automatically within 7 days even if there’s no acknowledgement from the Requester.

 After Requester has acknowledge delivery of the item or product, the Traveller and AIRFROV is not liable for any dispute, damages, or refund for the item and product to the Requester. Traveller and Requester may still settle any disputes privately to come to an settlement. AIRFROV is also not liable to refund any service fee. The guideline for handling refund follows the PayPal Buyer Protection found in this url: https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#7 as well as the PayPal Seller Protection. For accountability and to prevent any disputes the members should agree on registered mail to track and confirm receipt of product or to deal at the default collection centre.

 AIRFROV will assist to the best ability to resolve and mediate any dispute if necessary and has the final say.
