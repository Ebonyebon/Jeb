From this level, you can playback the recorded file both in the app and in the external player. 

Furthermore, the file manager allows file sharing, blocking or unlocking the recordings and images before the automatic erasure of single files and whole folders. 

All of these options can be found in the drop-down menu. To access this menu, make a long press on a chosen position on the files list."</string>
    <string name="information_view_player_msg">The player allows to play the recorded file together with the additional information recorded during recording. When you are recording with the GPS receiver, you can watch the travelled route and the current location on the map.</string>

From now on, you do not have to worry about the free memory. Activate the option of the automatic erasure of files to make the app take care of the free memory for other new recordings and photos.</string>
    <string name="information_view_preference_info_msg">"- This app has a wide range of setup capabilities and that is why it is recommended to perform application tests and to adjust it to fit your own preferences before the first use. 

- DriveCamRecorder may work improperly on the devices with a modified software (e.g.CyanogenMod) and it is the fault of the system. 

- Using the GPS receiver during recording, it is important to bear in mind that it will take a few minutes to locate your device  (it depends on the device you have and the signal strength). 

- In order to the further development of this app and its refinement, DriveCamRecorder sends anonymous usage statistics and crash reports."</string>
    <string name="information_view_preference_record_msg">"The Recording Settings allow you to configure the image of the recording file and the way of recording it. You have a weak battery and you want to be sure that your recording will be saved properly? Activate the option, which will allow you to stop recording when the given battery level is exceeded. 

Do you want to manage your recordings better? The option of cyclic records allows to make new recordings at a certain time. From now on, you do not have to store long recordings when something important happens. All you need to do is to block a single recording from the whole cycle of records. 

Advanced camera settings allow to adjust the parameters to fit your own preferences. 

Note: If there are any problems with image recording after changing advanced camera settings, the previous, running settings should be restored."</string>
    <string name="information_view_recording_background_msg">"Do you want to use your favorite app that acts as a navigation? Nothing simpler. Use the possibility of background recording so that your device will become not only a video recorder but also a navigation. 

This functionality was made for those that feel no need to keep track of the recorded material and for those that want to save the energy. The background recording may be carried out when the device is blocked and the screen is turned off. 

Use the notification that is located in the notification bar to turn the recording off, take a picture and to block it before it is automatically deleted."</string>
    <string name="information_view_recording_msg">"The preview image recording allows you to keep track of the recorded material (together with the date, speed and the recording time). 
Additional information, such as the accuracy of the current position, the coordinates that indicate it and the number of satellites, are placed in the menu. You can start the menu by clicking the preview image. 
Moreover, from the drop down menu, you can start the image recording and change the settings of the sound recording. 

The padlock icon allows to block the recording before it is automatically deleted. Use it, when you want to save something that happens on your way. 

An image icon allows you to take a quick picture. You can use this option even if the recording is not in progress. All images, taken as parts of one recording, are integrated with it. This means that blocking the recording before the automatic erasure of files, blocks also the erasure of images. 

While recording and using a GPS receiver, there is the satellite icon which shows the status of the GPS receiver. 

Note: taking pictures due to technical limitations does not work on all devices."</string>
